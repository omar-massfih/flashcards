What is an `if` expression used for (Rust)?	Branching: run a block when a condition is true; optionally run an `else` block when false.
What type must a Rust `if` condition have?	`bool`.
Does Rust perform truthy/falsy coercions for `if` conditions?	No; conditions must be explicitly boolean.
What happens if an `if` condition is false and there is no `else`?	The `if` block is skipped and execution continues.
What is `else if` used for?	Checking multiple conditions in sequence.
In an `if`/`else if` chain, how many branches run?	At most one: the first branch whose condition is true.
Why can “too many `else if`” be a code smell (per TRPL)?	It can clutter code; consider refactoring (e.g., using `match` for complex branching).
What are the blocks in an `if` expression sometimes called?	Arms (similar terminology to `match`).
Is `if` a statement or an expression in Rust?	An expression (it can produce a value).
What does “`if` is an expression” enable in Rust?	Using `if` on the right-hand side of `let` to choose a value.
When using `if` in `let`, what must be true about the result types of each arm?	All possible arm results must have the same type.
Why must those arm result types match (Rust)?	A variable has a single compile-time type; Rust must know it definitively.
What common compile error happens when `if` and `else` produce different types?	An error that the `if` and `else` have incompatible types (type mismatch).
What problem does `if let` solve (Rust)?	Run code for one matching pattern without writing a full `match` with boilerplate like `_ => ()`.
In `if let PATTERN = EXPR`, what separates the pattern and the expression (Rust)?	An equals sign: `if let <pattern> = <expr> { ... }`.
In `if let Some(x) = opt { ... }`, where is `x` in scope (Rust)?	Only inside the `if let` block (and its `else` is a separate scope).
Why can `if let` be considered syntax sugar for `match` (Rust)?	It’s like `match expr { PATTERN => { ... }, _ => () }` (optionally with an `else` arm).
What tradeoff do you make by using `if let` instead of `match` (Rust)?	Conciseness vs losing `match`’s exhaustiveness checking.
In `if let ... else { ... }`, what is the `else` block equivalent to in `match` terms (Rust)?	The `_ => { ... }` catch-all arm.
What is `let...else` used for (Rust)?	Pattern-match to bind names in the outer scope on success; otherwise run an `else` that exits the current flow (“happy path”).
What is the basic syntax shape of `let...else` (Rust)?	`let PATTERN = EXPR else { ... };`
If the pattern matches in `let...else`, where do bindings live (Rust)?	In the surrounding scope after the `let...else` statement (not inside a success block).
If the pattern does not match in `let...else`, what must the `else` block do (Rust)?	It must diverge (e.g., `return`, `break`, `continue`, or `panic!`), because execution can’t continue with missing bindings.
Why does `let...else` “stay on the happy path” (Rust)?	The main logic continues unindented after the binding; non-matching cases exit early in `else`.
When is `let...else` a good fit versus `if let { ... } else { return ... }` (Rust)?	When you want to bind a value for later code and handle the non-match with an early-exit `else` (clearer control flow).
What are the three kinds of loops in Rust?	`loop`, `while`, and `for`.
What is one practical use-case for an infinite-style loop besides “repeat forever”?	Retrying an operation until it succeeds / a condition is met.
How can a `loop` produce a value (Rust)?	Use `break <expr>`; the loop expression evaluates to that value.
Where does the value from `break <expr>` go?	It becomes the value of the entire `loop` expression (often bound with `let result = loop { ... };`).
What is the difference between `break` and `return` in this context?	`break` exits the current loop; `return` exits the current function.
In nested loops, which loop do `break` and `continue` affect by default?	The innermost loop at that point.
What is a loop label used for?	Disambiguating which loop `break`/`continue` should apply to in nested loops.
What is the syntax shape of a labeled loop?	`'label: loop { ... }` (label starts with a single quote).
How do you break an outer labeled loop from inside an inner loop?	`break 'label;`.
What does a `while` loop represent (Rust)?	“Run while condition is true; stop when it becomes false.”
Why does `while` reduce nesting versus `loop` + `if` + `break` patterns?	The condition is built into the loop construct, so it’s clearer and less nested.
What is a common use of `while` shown in TRPL?	Counting down until a condition (e.g., `number != 0`) becomes false.
What is a `for` loop primarily used for (Rust)?	Iterating over items in a collection/iterator.
Why is iterating with `while` + manual index considered error-prone?	Off-by-one mistakes can cause panics (out-of-bounds) or skipped elements.
Why can `while` + manual indexing also be slower?	It can require repeated bounds checks / comparisons each iteration.
Why is `for` preferred when iterating a collection (TRPL’s emphasis)?	Safer, more concise, and often more efficient.
What advantage does `for` have when the collection length changes?	You don’t need to update an index bound; it iterates the elements directly.
What does TRPL recommend as the most commonly used loop construct in Rust?	`for`.
What standard-library concept is used to run a loop a fixed number of times?	A range (an iterator producing a sequence of numbers).
What does calling `.rev()` on an iterator do (conceptually)?	Reverses the iteration order.
Why might you wrap a range in parentheses before calling `.rev()`?	To call the method on the range expression as a whole, e.g., `(1..4).rev()`.
