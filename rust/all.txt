What is Cargo in the Rust ecosystem?	The included dependency manager and build tool.
What does Cargo make easier?	Adding, compiling, and managing dependencies consistently.
What is rustfmt used for?	Automatic formatting to keep a consistent coding style.
Name three example domains where Rust is used in production.	Command line tools; web services; embedded devices.
What is rustup?	A command-line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools.
Besides the compiler, what system tool is needed to produce a final executable?	A linker.
How do you update Rust installed via rustup?	Run `rustup update`.
How do you uninstall Rust and rustup?	Run `rustup self uninstall`.
How do you open the locally installed Rust documentation?	Run `rustup doc`.
After caching dependencies, how do you run Cargo commands without network access?	Use the `--offline` flag.
What file extension do Rust source files use?	`.rs`
What is the convention for multi-word Rust filenames?	Use underscores (e.g., `hello_world.rs`).
What is special about the `main` function in an executable Rust program?	It is the first code that runs.
In `fn main() {}`, what does `fn` declare?	A function.
How are function bodies written in Rust?	Inside curly braces `{}` (required for function bodies).
What does `println!` do in the Hello World example?	Prints the provided text to the screen/terminal.
What does the `!` in `println!` indicate?	It’s a macro invocation, not a normal function call.
What does a semicolon `;` typically indicate at the end of a line in Rust?	The expression/statement is finished.
How do you compile `main.rs` from the command line?	Run `rustc main.rs`.
After successful compilation with `rustc`, what do you get to run?	A binary executable.
How do you run the compiled executable on Linux/macOS?	`./main`
How do you run the compiled executable on Windows?	`.\\main`
What does it mean that Rust is ahead-of-time compiled?	You can compile to an executable that can run without Rust installed on the target machine.
Why use Cargo instead of `rustc` directly as projects grow?	To manage options/dependencies and make sharing/building easier.
What is Cargo?	Rust’s build system and package manager.
What kinds of tasks does Cargo handle for you?	Building your code, downloading dependencies, and building those dependencies.
Why do most Rust projects use Cargo?	It automates common project tasks and makes managing dependencies easier.
How can you check whether Cargo is installed?	Run `cargo --version`.
What does `cargo new <name>` do?	Creates a new project directory with a starter Rust program and Cargo config.
What two top-level items does Cargo generate in a new binary project (besides the `src` dir)?	`Cargo.toml` and a `src/` directory (with `main.rs` inside `src/`).
Where does Cargo expect Rust source files to live?	Inside the `src/` directory.
What is the purpose of the top-level project directory in a Cargo project?	For config and project files (README, licenses, config), not the main source code.
What is `Cargo.toml`?	The project’s Cargo configuration file.
What file format is `Cargo.toml` written in?	TOML.
What does the `[package]` section in `Cargo.toml` contain?	Package configuration metadata (like name/version/edition).
What does the `[dependencies]` section in `Cargo.toml` list?	The crates (dependencies) your project uses.
In Rust, packages of code are referred to as what?	Crates.
How do you build a Cargo project?	Run `cargo build`.
What does Cargo’s default build produce?	A debug build intended for development.
Where does Cargo store build outputs by default?	In the `target/` directory (debug builds under `target/debug`).
What does `cargo run` do?	Builds (if needed) and then runs the program.
When will `cargo run` rebuild your program?	When the source files have changed since the last build.
What does `cargo check` do?	Checks that code compiles but does not produce an executable.
Why use `cargo check` during development?	It’s usually faster feedback than a full build.
What is `Cargo.lock` for?	It records the exact versions of dependencies used in the project.
Should you edit `Cargo.lock` manually?	No—Cargo manages it.
How do you build with optimizations for release?	Run `cargo build --release`.
What’s the trade-off of `cargo build --release`?	Faster runtime, but slower compile times.
Where do release build outputs go?	Under `target/release`.
When does Cargo provide the biggest advantage over calling `rustc` directly?	As projects grow (multiple files) or when you add dependencies.
How can you convert an existing non-Cargo project to use Cargo?	Move code into `src/` and create a `Cargo.toml` (or run `cargo init`).
What does `loop { ... }` do?	Creates an infinite loop that runs until you exit it (e.g., with `break`).
What does `break` do in a loop?	Exits the nearest enclosing loop immediately.
What does `continue` do in a loop?	Skips the rest of the current loop iteration and starts the next iteration.
What is the Rust prelude?	A set of standard-library items automatically in scope in every program.
When do you write a `use ...;` statement?	To bring a module/type/trait into scope when it isn’t already available (e.g., not in the prelude) or to shorten paths.
What does `::` mean in Rust paths?	It separates path segments (modules/types/traits) and is used to access associated items (e.g., `Type::function`).
What is an associated function?	A function defined on a type and called with `Type::function`, not on an instance.
Are variables mutable by default?	No; bindings are immutable by default.
What does `mut` mean on a binding?	It allows reassignment of the binding and/or mutation through it (when the type supports mutation).
What is `String` (std) in one phrase?	A growable, UTF-8–encoded owned string.
What does `&T` mean?	A shared (immutable) reference to a value of type `T`.
What does `&mut T` mean?	A mutable reference to a value of type `T` (allows mutation through the reference).
Why pass `&mut T` to a function?	So the function can mutate a caller-owned value without taking ownership of it.
What is `std::io::stdin()` conceptually?	A handle to standard input that you can read user input from.
What does `read_line(&mut String)` return?	A `Result` indicating success (`Ok(...)`) or failure (`Err(...)`).
What does `read_line` do to the string buffer?	It appends the input line (including the trailing newline) to the `String`.
What is method chaining?	Calling methods on returned values in sequence, like `a().b().c()`.
What is `Result<T, E>`?	An enum that represents either success (`Ok(T)`) or failure (`Err(E)`).
What are the `Result` variants?	`Ok` and `Err`.
What does `expect("msg")` do on a `Result`?	If `Ok`, unwraps the value; if `Err`, panics and prints the provided message.
What is `match` used for?	Branching on patterns (often enum variants) in an exhaustive way and producing a value.
What does the wildcard pattern `_` mean?	Match anything (catch-all), ignoring the matched value.
What does `trim()` do (Rust strings)?	Removes leading and trailing whitespace (including `\n` / `\r\n`).
What does `parse::<T>()` do?	Attempts to convert a string to type `T`, returning a `Result`.
Why does `parse` return a `Result`?	Because the conversion can fail for invalid input.
Why add a type annotation like `: u32`?	To guide type inference and choose the concrete type you want.
What is shadowing?	Re-declaring a name to bind it to a new value (possibly a different type) in the same scope.
What does “static typing” mean?	Types are checked at compile time, and many mismatches are rejected before the program runs.
Why can’t you compare values of different types directly?	Operations like comparison require compatible types; Rust forces explicit conversions instead of implicit type mixing.
What is `std::cmp::Ordering` for?	Representing comparison outcomes: `Less`, `Greater`, or `Equal`.
What does `cmp(&other)` return?	An `Ordering` describing how two values compare.
Difference between `start..end` and `start..=end`?	`start..end` excludes `end`; `start..=end` includes `end`.
What does `{name}` do in `println!`?	Inserts the value of the named variable into the output.
Is `match` an expression or a statement?	An expression: it evaluates to a value, so you can write `let x = match ...;`.
What does a `match` arm consist of?	A pattern to match and an expression/block to run when it matches.
What does a pattern like `Ok(num)` do in a `match`?	It matches the `Ok` variant and binds the inner value to `num`.
Why must `match` be exhaustive?	Rust requires handling all possible cases (or using `_`) so you don’t miss a variant.
What is “turbofish” syntax `::<T>` used for?	To specify generic type parameters explicitly, e.g., `parse::<u32>()`.
Why bring a trait into scope with `use`?	To make the trait’s methods available for method-call syntax on compatible types.
