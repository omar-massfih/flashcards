What two subsets of data types does TRPL highlight?	Scalar types and compound types.
What is a scalar type (Rust)?	A type that represents a single value; Rust’s primary scalar types are integers, floats, booleans, and chars.
What is a compound type (Rust)?	A type that groups multiple values into one; Rust’s primitive compound types are tuples and arrays.
Integer types: what do `i*` vs `u*` mean (Rust)?	`i*` is signed (can be negative); `u*` is unsigned (nonnegative).
What does a type like `u32` indicate?	An unsigned 32-bit integer.
What built-in integer sizes does Rust provide?	8/16/32/64/128-bit signed+unsigned plus `isize`/`usize`.
What determines the size of `isize`/`usize`?	The target architecture (64-bit on 64-bit platforms; 32-bit on 32-bit platforms).
What integer type does Rust default to when unspecified?	`i32`.
When is `usize` commonly used in Rust?	For indexing collections/arrays and sizes/lengths.
How can you write integer literals in hex/octal/binary (Rust)?	Hex `0x...`; octal `0o...`; binary `0b...`; decimal is the default.
What is a numeric type suffix on a literal?	A suffix like `57u8` that explicitly selects the literal’s type.
What does `_` do in numeric literals (Rust)?	It’s a visual separator only (e.g., `1_000` equals `1000`).
What is integer overflow (Rust)?	When a value exceeds the range a fixed-size integer type can represent.
What happens on integer overflow in debug builds (Rust)?	Runtime overflow checks cause a panic when overflow occurs.
What happens on integer overflow in release builds by default (Rust)?	It wraps using two’s complement wrapping (no overflow panic by default).
What are the four method families for handling overflow explicitly?	`wrapping_*`; `checked_*`; `overflowing_*`; `saturating_*`.
What do `wrapping_*` methods do?	Always wrap on overflow (in all build modes).
What do `checked_*` methods do on overflow?	Return `None` (an `Option` indicating overflow).
What do `overflowing_*` methods return?	The wrapped value and a boolean indicating whether overflow happened.
What do `saturating_*` methods do?	Clamp results at the type’s min/max instead of wrapping.
What floating-point types does Rust have?	`f32` and `f64`.
What floating-point type does Rust default to?	`f64`.
How does integer division behave in Rust?	It truncates toward zero.
What is the boolean type called in Rust?	`bool` (values `true` and `false`).
How do you write a `char` literal vs a string literal (Rust)?	`char` uses single quotes (e.g., `'z'`); strings use double quotes (e.g., "z").
What does `char` represent in Rust (and size)?	A Unicode scalar value; `char` is 4 bytes.
What is a tuple (Rust)?	A fixed-length compound type that can hold values of different types.
What does a tuple type annotation look like?	`(T1, T2, T3)`.
How do you destructure a tuple (Rust)?	Use a pattern: `let (x, y, z) = tup;`.
How do you access tuple elements by index (Rust)?	Use dot-indexing: `tup.0`, `tup.1`, etc.
What is the unit type/value in Rust?	`()`; an empty value / empty return type.
What is an array in Rust (core properties)?	A fixed-length collection where every element has the same type.
What is Rust array type syntax (including repeat init)?	`[T; N]` and repeat init like `[value; N]`.
Arrays vs vectors: when should you prefer `Vec<T>` over arrays?	When you need a growable/shrinkable collection; if unsure, use a vector.
What happens on out-of-bounds array indexing in Rust (and why)?	It panics at runtime via bounds checks to prevent invalid memory access (memory safety).
