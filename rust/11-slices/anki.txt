What is a slice in Rust?	A reference to a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection (it does not own the data).
Why can returning a `usize` index into a `String` be brittle (Rust)?	The number is only meaningful for that specific string state; the string can change and the index becomes invalid.
What problem do string slices solve compared to returning indices (Rust)?	They tie the “substring” result to the underlying data via borrowing, so invalid states are rejected by the compiler.
What is a string slice type in Rust?	`&str`.
How do you create a string slice from a `String` (Rust)?	With range syntax: `&s[start..end]` (e.g., `&s[..2]`, `&s[3..]`, `&s[..]`).
In Rust slice ranges like `a..b`, is `b` inclusive or exclusive?	Exclusive: `a..b` includes `a` up to but not including `b`.
What does `&s[..]` mean for a `String` in Rust?	A slice of the entire string.
What does omitting the start in a slice range mean (Rust)?	Start at index 0 (e.g., `&s[..n]`).
What does omitting the end in a slice range mean (Rust)?	Go to the end (e.g., `&s[n..]`).
What does a string slice store internally (high level)?	A pointer into the string data plus a length.
What constraint applies to string-slice indices in Rust (`&s[a..b]`)?	They must be at valid UTF-8 character boundaries; slicing in the middle of a multibyte char will panic.
Why is `fn f(s: &str)` more flexible than `fn f(s: &String)` (Rust)?	`&str` works with both string literals and `String` values (via deref coercions / slicing).
What is the type of a string literal in Rust (e.g., `"Hello"`)?	`&'static str` (a string slice pointing into the binary).
Why are Rust string literals immutable?	They are `&str` slices pointing to read-only data baked into the binary.
How can you iterate over a `String` as bytes (Rust)?	Use `s.as_bytes()` to get a `&[u8]`.
What does `enumerate()` add to an iterator (Rust)?	It yields `(index, item)` pairs.
In `for (i, &b) in bytes.iter().enumerate()`, why use `&b` in the pattern (Rust)?	Because `iter()` yields `&u8`, and `&b` destructures/dereferences the reference to get the `u8` value.
What is `b' '` in Rust?	A byte literal (here: the ASCII space byte).
Why does Rust reject mutating a `String` while a slice into it is still used?	Borrowing rules: you can’t take a mutable borrow if an immutable borrow is still active and later used.
What is an array/slice slice type in Rust (general case)?	`&[T]` (e.g., slicing an array gives `&[i32]`).
How do you take a slice of an array in Rust?	With range syntax: `&a[start..end]` (e.g., `let s = &a[1..3];`).
