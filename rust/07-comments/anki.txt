Why do programmers write comments?	To add extra explanation for humans when code needs clarification.
What is the idiomatic single-line comment syntax in Rust?	Start with `//` (comment continues to the end of the line).
How do you write a multi-line comment using `//` in Rust?	Use `//` at the start of each line.
Where can `//` comments be placed in Rust code?	On their own line above code or at the end of a line containing code.
Which comment placement is more commonly seen in Rust style: end-of-line or above-line?	More often on a separate line above the code it annotates.
What does “the comment continues until the end of the line” mean?	Everything after `//` on that line is treated as comment text.
Besides `//` comments, what other kind of comment does Rust have?	Documentation comments (covered later in TRPL, e.g., publishing a crate).
