# Rust flashcards (TRPL)

This folder contains Anki **Basic** flashcards created while working through *The Rust Programming Language* (TRPL).

Source: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

## Structure
- Each chapter/topic lives in a numbered subfolder to keep a stable study order (e.g., `01-intro`, `02-installation`).
- Each subfolder contains an `anki.txt` file with tab-delimited cards.
- `rust/all.txt` is the combined deck built from all `*/anki.txt` files in this folder (recommended import).

## Rules and workflow
- Repo-wide import notes: `README.md`
