What does `loop { ... }` do?	Creates an infinite loop that runs until you exit it (e.g., with `break`).
What does `break` do in a loop?	Exits the nearest enclosing loop immediately.
What does `continue` do in a loop?	Skips the rest of the current loop iteration and starts the next iteration.
What is the Rust prelude?	A set of standard-library items automatically in scope in every program.
When do you write a `use ...;` statement?	To bring a module/type/trait into scope when it isn’t already available (e.g., not in the prelude) or to shorten paths.
What does `::` mean in Rust paths?	It separates path segments (modules/types/traits) and is used to access associated items (e.g., `Type::function`).
What is an associated function?	A function defined on a type and called with `Type::function`, not on an instance.
Are variables mutable by default?	No; bindings are immutable by default.
What does `mut` mean on a binding?	It allows reassignment of the binding and/or mutation through it (when the type supports mutation).
What is `String` (std) in one phrase?	A growable, UTF-8–encoded owned string.
What does `&T` mean?	A shared (immutable) reference to a value of type `T`.
What does `&mut T` mean?	A mutable reference to a value of type `T` (allows mutation through the reference).
Why pass `&mut T` to a function?	So the function can mutate a caller-owned value without taking ownership of it.
What is `std::io::stdin()` conceptually?	A handle to standard input that you can read user input from.
What does `read_line(&mut String)` return?	A `Result` indicating success (`Ok(...)`) or failure (`Err(...)`).
What does `read_line` do to the string buffer?	It appends the input line (including the trailing newline) to the `String`.
What is method chaining?	Calling methods on returned values in sequence, like `a().b().c()`.
What is `Result<T, E>`?	An enum that represents either success (`Ok(T)`) or failure (`Err(E)`).
What are the `Result` variants?	`Ok` and `Err`.
What does `expect("msg")` do on a `Result`?	If `Ok`, unwraps the value; if `Err`, panics and prints the provided message.
What is `match` used for?	Branching on patterns (often enum variants) in an exhaustive way and producing a value.
What does the wildcard pattern `_` mean?	Match anything (catch-all), ignoring the matched value.
What does `trim()` do (Rust strings)?	Removes leading and trailing whitespace (including `\n` / `\r\n`).
What does `parse::<T>()` do?	Attempts to convert a string to type `T`, returning a `Result`.
Why does `parse` return a `Result`?	Because the conversion can fail for invalid input.
Why add a type annotation like `: u32`?	To guide type inference and choose the concrete type you want.
What is shadowing?	Re-declaring a name to bind it to a new value (possibly a different type) in the same scope.
What does “static typing” mean?	Types are checked at compile time, and many mismatches are rejected before the program runs.
Why can’t you compare values of different types directly?	Operations like comparison require compatible types; Rust forces explicit conversions instead of implicit type mixing.
What is `std::cmp::Ordering` for?	Representing comparison outcomes: `Less`, `Greater`, or `Equal`.
What does `cmp(&other)` return?	An `Ordering` describing how two values compare.
Difference between `start..end` and `start..=end`?	`start..end` excludes `end`; `start..=end` includes `end`.
What does `{name}` do in `println!`?	Inserts the value of the named variable into the output.
Is `match` an expression or a statement?	An expression: it evaluates to a value, so you can write `let x = match ...;`.
What does a `match` arm consist of?	A pattern to match and an expression/block to run when it matches.
What does a pattern like `Ok(num)` do in a `match`?	It matches the `Ok` variant and binds the inner value to `num`.
Why must `match` be exhaustive?	Rust requires handling all possible cases (or using `_`) so you don’t miss a variant.
What is “turbofish” syntax `::<T>` used for?	To specify generic type parameters explicitly, e.g., `parse::<u32>()`.
Why bring a trait into scope with `use`?	To make the trait’s methods available for method-call syntax on compatible types.
