What is the key question at each layer of a data model stack?	How is this data represented in terms of the next-lower layer?
What is the relational model?	Data organized into relations (tables) — unordered collections of tuples (rows); proposed by Edgar Codd in 1970
What is the object-relational impedance mismatch?	The disconnect between object-oriented application code and the relational table/row/column model — requires a translation layer
What is an ORM framework?	A library (e.g. ActiveRecord, Hibernate) that reduces translation boilerplate between objects and relational tables — but can't fully hide the differences
What are the three main ways to represent one-to-many relationships in relational databases?	Separate tables with foreign keys; structured/XML/JSON datatype columns; or encoding as text in a single column (not queryable)
Why use IDs rather than plain-text strings for values like region or industry?	IDs never change even if the human-meaningful value changes; duplicating text risks inconsistencies when updates are needed
What is normalization in databases?	Removing duplication by storing each fact in exactly one place and referencing it by ID
What was IBM's IMS, and how does it compare to document databases?	A 1960s hierarchical database storing data as nested records (like JSON) — worked for one-to-many but poorly handled many-to-many and had no joins
What was the network model (CODASYL)?	A generalization of the hierarchical model where records could have multiple parents, linked by pointer-like chains called access paths
What was the key problem with CODASYL access paths?	Programmers had to manually track all paths to reach data; changing access paths required rewriting all query code — very inflexible
How did the relational model improve on the hierarchical and network models?	Laid all data in open tables (no nested structures); the query optimizer automatically selects access paths; adding new indexes/queries doesn't require rewriting code
What is a query optimizer?	A component of a relational database that automatically decides which indexes and join methods to use and in which order — built once, benefits all queries
When is the document model a good fit?	When data has a document-like structure (tree of one-to-many relationships) that is typically loaded all at once
When does the document model become less appealing?	When the application requires many-to-many relationships — joins are weakly supported, and denormalization creates consistency work
What is schema-on-read?	The data structure is implicit and only interpreted at read time (document databases) — analogous to dynamic/runtime type checking
What is schema-on-write?	The schema is explicit and enforced by the database at write time (relational databases) — analogous to static/compile-time type checking
When is schema-on-read advantageous over schema-on-write?	When items in a collection are heterogeneous (different structures), or when structure is determined by external systems you don't control
What is the data locality advantage of document databases?	A document is stored as a single continuous string — fetching the whole document requires one query and no multi-table joins
What are the downsides of document locality?	The entire document is loaded even when only part is needed; updates typically rewrite the whole document
What is a declarative query language?	A language (like SQL) where you specify what data you want, not how to retrieve it — the system's optimizer decides execution
What is an imperative query language?	A language where you specify step-by-step how to retrieve data — like IMS/CODASYL APIs
Why are declarative languages generally better for databases?	More concise; hide engine implementation details allowing optimization; easier to parallelize; DB can improve performance without changing queries
What is MapReduce?	A programming model for processing large amounts of data across many machines using map (emit key-value pairs) and reduce (aggregate) pure functions
What restrictions apply to MapReduce map and reduce functions?	Must be pure functions: only use passed input, no additional DB queries, no side effects — enables re-running anywhere in any order
What is MongoDB's aggregation pipeline?	A declarative, JSON-based query language added in MongoDB 2.2 as a more convenient alternative to hand-writing MapReduce
What kinds of data are best modeled as a graph?	Highly interconnected data with complex many-to-many relationships — social networks, web links, road networks
What are the two types of objects in a graph data model?	Vertices (also called nodes or entities) and edges (also called relationships or arcs)
