Terraform Azure prerequisite (account): what do you need?	An Azure subscription/account with permissions to create resources.
Terraform Azure prerequisite (tooling): what CLI is commonly used for auth?	The Azure CLI (used to authenticate locally).
What does `az login` do (Azure CLI)?	Authenticates you to Azure and lets CLI/Terraform use your account context.
How do you select the active Azure subscription in Azure CLI?	Use `az account set --subscription "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"`.
What is an Azure “service principal” in Terraform auth context?	An Azure AD application identity Terraform can use to authenticate and manage resources.
Why create a service principal for Terraform (Azure)?	To grant Terraform an identity with RBAC permissions to perform actions.
What does `az ad sp create-for-rbac` do (high level)?	Creates a service principal and assigns it an RBAC role over a given scope.
Security rule: what must you NOT do with service principal credentials?	Do not commit or share them (treat as secrets).
Azure provider auth (env vars): which `ARM_...` vars are commonly used?	`ARM_CLIENT_ID`; `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`; `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`; `ARM_TENANT_ID`.
How do you set Azure provider auth env vars in macOS/Linux shell?	Use `export ARM_CLIENT_ID="..."` etc.
Why prefer env vars over putting Azure credentials in Terraform config?	To reduce the chance of checking secrets into source control.
What is the purpose of the `terraform { ... }` block?	Terraform settings like required providers and Terraform CLI version constraints.
Where do you declare required providers in Terraform?	In `terraform { required_providers { ... } }`.
What does a provider `source` address like `hashicorp/azurerm` specify?	Which provider to install (from the Terraform Registry by default).
Why add a provider version constraint in `required_providers`?	To avoid unplanned upgrades that may introduce breaking changes.
What does the Terraform version constraint `required_version` do?	Prevents using Terraform CLI versions that don’t satisfy the constraint.
What does `~> 3.0.2` mean in a Terraform version constraint?	Allow `>= 3.0.2` and `< 3.1.0` (patch updates, not minor).
What is a Terraform `provider` block used for?	Configure a provider plugin (credentials, features, regions, etc.).
What is a Terraform `resource` block used for?	Declare an infrastructure object Terraform will manage.
Resource block structure (Terraform): what are the two strings after `resource`?	Resource type and resource name (e.g., `resource "TYPE" "NAME"`).
What is a Terraform resource address (format)?	`<resource_type>.<resource_name>` (e.g., `azurerm_resource_group.rg`).
What does `terraform init` do?	Initializes the working directory (downloads providers/modules; sets up backend).
What does `terraform plan` do?	Shows a preview of changes needed to reach the desired state.
What does `terraform apply` do?	Applies the planned changes to create/update/destroy infrastructure.
Why is it safe to abort at the `terraform apply` confirmation prompt?	No changes are made until you approve and proceed.
What does `terraform fmt` do?	Formats `.tf` files to canonical Terraform style.
What does `terraform validate` do?	Checks configuration syntax and internal consistency (without applying).
What file does Terraform use to record deployed infrastructure state by default?	`terraform.tfstate`.
Why must you protect `terraform.tfstate`?	It can contain sensitive data in plaintext; don’t share or commit it.
What does `terraform state list` do?	Lists resource addresses tracked in the current state.
