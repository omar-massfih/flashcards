Why store Terraform state remotely (production)?	To keep state secure/encrypted and enable team collaboration via shared state access.
What is HCP Terraform (high level)?	A hosted Terraform platform for collaboration (versioning/auditing runs), remote execution, and remote state storage.
Why run Terraform in a remote environment (HCP Terraform)?	It provides shared access to state and a stable environment for long-running Terraform operations.
How do you configure HCP Terraform in Terraform CLI workflow (HCL block)?	Use a `terraform { cloud { organization = "..."; workspaces { name = "..." } } }` block.
What is an HCP Terraform workspace (conceptually)?	A named context that holds state and run history for a configuration.
Why does the tutorial require Terraform `>= 1.1.0`?	The `cloud { ... }` block requires newer Terraform versions.
If `cloud { ... }` isn’t supported, what older alternative is mentioned?	Use the `remote` backend block to configure the CLI workflow and migrate state.
What does `terraform login` do (HCP Terraform)?	Authenticates the CLI to HCP Terraform by obtaining/storing an API token.
Where does `terraform login` store the HCP Terraform token?	In `~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` (stored in plain text).
Why should you protect `credentials.tfrc.json`?	It contains an API token; anyone with the file can access HCP Terraform as you.
After adding a `cloud` block, what Terraform command reinitializes and detects it?	`terraform init`.
During `terraform init`, what does “migrate your existing state” mean?	Copy the latest local state snapshot into the configured HCP Terraform workspace.
In the migration prompt, what does answering `yes` do?	Copies the local state snapshot to the HCP Terraform workspace.
In the migration prompt, what does answering `no` do?	Activates the configured HCP Terraform workspace without copying local state.
After migrating state to HCP Terraform, why delete the local `terraform.tfstate`?	To avoid keeping sensitive state on disk and to prevent using stale local state by mistake.
What is the default execution mode for HCP Terraform CLI-driven workflow?	Remote execution (Terraform operations run in HCP Terraform).
What does “local execution” mean with HCP Terraform (CLI-driven)?	Terraform runs locally but stores state remotely in HCP Terraform.
Where should you set Azure `ARM_...` auth variables when using HCP Terraform?	In the HCP Terraform workspace Variables UI (not only as local shell exports).
Which Azure auth value should be marked sensitive in HCP Terraform variables?	`ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`.
How do you create an Azure service principal for Terraform access (Azure CLI)?	`az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"`.
After migrating state, what does “No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.” indicate?	Terraform found no diffs between configuration and real resources, so no actions are needed.
What does the tutorial claim about how remote state is loaded when used?	Remote state is loaded only in memory when Terraform needs it.
What two main workflows does HCP Terraform support (names)?	VCS-driven workflow and API-driven workflow.
What triggers runs in an HCP Terraform VCS-driven workflow?	Commits/changes to the connected VCS repository queue plans/runs automatically.
