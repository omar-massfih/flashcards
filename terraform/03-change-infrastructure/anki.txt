What does it mean to “change infrastructure” in Terraform?	Edit configuration, then run `terraform apply` to create/update resources to match the new desired state.
How do you add a new resource in Terraform (conceptually)?	Add a new `resource "TYPE" "NAME" { ... }` block to your configuration.
How do you reference another resource’s attribute in Terraform config?	Use `<TYPE>.<NAME>.<ATTRIBUTE>` (e.g., `azurerm_resource_group.rg.name`).
What does referencing `azurerm_resource_group.rg.name` accomplish in another resource?	Uses the existing resource’s value and creates an implicit dependency between the resources.
Why does Terraform create a dependency graph?	To ensure resources are created/updated in a valid order based on references.
In Terraform plan output, what does `+ create` indicate?	A new resource will be created.
In Terraform plan output, what does `~ update in-place` indicate?	An existing resource will be modified without replacing it.
What does it mean to “update in-place” (Terraform)?	The resource is modified while keeping the same identity/address; it is not destroyed and recreated.
In plan output, what does “(known after apply)” mean?	The value is computed by the provider during apply and isn’t known at plan time.
What does “Refreshing state...” mean during `terraform apply`?	Terraform is reading current real-world resource data to synchronize state before planning/applying changes.
Why can adding a reference create an implicit dependency without `depends_on`?	Because Terraform can infer ordering from the expression graph (data flow) in configuration.
What Azure resource is added in this tutorial example?	An Azure virtual network resource (`azurerm_virtual_network`).
What is the purpose of `resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name` (Azure example)?	Places the VNet in the same resource group and ties its lifecycle ordering to the resource group.
What kind of value is `address_space` for an Azure VNet in Terraform?	A list of CIDR blocks (e.g., `["10.0.0.0/16"]`).
What does a CIDR block like `10.0.0.0/16` represent (high level)?	An IP address range; `/16` indicates the prefix length (network size).
Why should you avoid hardcoding values like `location` when they may differ by account/region?	Some regions may be unavailable; prefer configuration/variables when portability matters.
What does it mean that a new resource “references your resource group” (tutorial phrasing)?	The new resource’s arguments use values from the resource group, so Terraform orders creation accordingly.
After changing Terraform configuration, what command applies the change?	`terraform apply`.
What does the `tags` block do on a Terraform resource (Azure example)?	Assigns metadata key/value tags to the resource.
In HCL, what is the type/shape of `tags = { ... }`?	A map/object of keys to values (e.g., `Environment = "..."`).
Why are tags useful in cloud infrastructure?	They help with organization, ownership, environment labeling, and cost/accounting policies.
How does Terraform show tag additions in a plan?	As an in-place update (`~`) with new keys/values added under `tags`.
What’s the difference between creating a new resource vs modifying an existing one (Terraform)?	Create adds a new managed object; modify changes attributes of an existing managed object (often in-place).
What does the plan summary “Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy” mean?	Counts of create/change/destroy actions Terraform intends to take.
What does the plan summary “Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy” mean?	Terraform will update one existing resource and create/destroy none.
What does it mean that Terraform “only accepts ‘yes’” at the prompt?	`terraform apply` requires explicit confirmation before making changes.
What does the resource address `azurerm_virtual_network.vnet` identify?	The specific managed resource instance: `<TYPE>.<NAME>`.
What does `terraform show` help you verify after an apply?	It displays the current state values Terraform knows for managed resources (including updated tags).
Why might Terraform show `id = (known after apply)` during planning?	IDs are assigned by the provider/cloud when the resource is created.
What is the key mental model behind Terraform changes?	Terraform compares desired configuration to current tracked state and applies actions to converge them.
