What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?	Managing infrastructure using configuration files instead of manual GUI/point-and-click changes.
What does IaC enable (core benefit list)?	Safe; consistent; repeatable infrastructure changes via versionable configuration.
Why is IaC “safer” than manual changes (in principle)?	Changes are explicit, reviewable, and reproducible from versioned config.
What is Terraform (in one sentence)?	HashiCorp’s IaC tool that defines infrastructure in declarative config files and manages its lifecycle.
What does “declarative configuration” mean (Terraform)?	You describe the desired end-state; Terraform determines the actions to reach it.
Terraform: what is a provider?	A plugin that lets Terraform interact with a platform/service via its API.
Terraform: what does a provider interact with?	Cloud platforms and services via their application programming interfaces (APIs).
Where do you find Terraform providers?	The Terraform Registry (and you can write your own if needed).
Terraform: what is a resource (conceptually)?	An individual unit of infrastructure managed by Terraform (e.g., compute instance, network).
Terraform: what is a module?	A reusable Terraform configuration composed from resources (possibly across providers).
Why are modules useful?	They let you reuse and standardize infrastructure patterns.
How does Terraform handle dependencies between resources?	It automatically calculates dependencies to create/destroy in the correct order.
Terraform workflow: what are the core steps?	Scope; Author; Initialize; Plan; Apply.
Terraform workflow: what does “Scope” mean?	Identify the infrastructure needed for the project.
Terraform workflow: what does “Author” mean?	Write the configuration that describes the desired infrastructure.
Terraform workflow: what does “Initialize” do?	Install the plugins/providers Terraform needs to manage infrastructure.
Terraform workflow: what does “Plan” do?	Preview the changes Terraform will make to match the configuration.
Terraform workflow: what does “Apply” do?	Make the planned changes to reach the desired state.
What is Terraform state (purpose)?	A state file that tracks real infrastructure and acts as a source of truth.
How does Terraform use state during deployments?	It compares desired config to state to decide what changes to make.
Why is version control valuable with Terraform configurations?	It enables safe collaboration and change tracking via code review and history.
What is a remote state backend used for?	To securely share state and coordinate access for team collaboration.
What problem do remote backends help prevent?	Race conditions when multiple people apply changes concurrently.
What is HCP Terraform used for (high level)?	Hosted Terraform that can share state, run Terraform in a stable environment, and support collaboration.
How can Terraform integrate with VCS (high level)?	Connect to GitHub/GitLab/etc. to propose infra changes when config changes are committed.
