Why use output values in Terraform?	To avoid digging through many resource attributes by exposing only the values you care about.
What is an output value (Terraform)?	A declared value (in an `output` block) that Terraform records and can display/query for the user.
When does Terraform print output values?	After `terraform apply` completes (it prints an “Outputs” section).
How do you query saved outputs from the CLI (Terraform)?	Run `terraform output`.
How do you query a single output by name (Terraform)?	`terraform output <output_name>` (e.g., `terraform output resource_group_id`).
Where do you typically define outputs (Terraform)?	In `.tf` files (often `outputs.tf`), using `output "..." { ... }`.
What is the basic syntax of an output block (Terraform)?	`output "name" { value = <expression> }`.
What does the output block name represent (Terraform)?	The output variable’s name (the key users query with `terraform output`).
Why should output names follow Terraform identifier conventions?	So they can be referenced cleanly (e.g., as module outputs used by other configurations).
How do you set an output’s value (Terraform)?	With `value = <expression>` inside the output block.
How do you reference a resource attribute in an output (Terraform)?	Use `<TYPE>.<NAME>.<ATTRIBUTE>` (e.g., `azurerm_resource_group.rg.id`).
Example: output a resource group ID (Terraform Azure)?	`value = azurerm_resource_group.rg.id`.
Can you define multiple outputs (Terraform)?	Yes; you can add multiple `output` blocks.
Do outputs change real infrastructure by themselves (Terraform)?	No; they expose values—`apply` may update state/outputs without changing resources.
After adding an output to an already-applied config, what must you run to see it?	Re-run `terraform apply`.
In plan output, what does “Changes to Outputs:” mean?	Terraform will update which outputs are recorded in state and shown after apply.
Can `terraform apply` save new outputs without changing resources?	Yes; the plan can be `0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy` while outputs change.
Where are output values stored between runs (Terraform)?	In Terraform state (local `terraform.tfstate` or a remote backend state).
Why are outputs useful in complex configurations?	They surface a few important values from hundreds/thousands of tracked attributes.
How does a parent configuration reference a child module’s output (Terraform)?	`module.<module_name>.<output_name>`.
What does `sensitive = true` do for an output (Terraform)?	Marks the output as sensitive so Terraform suppresses it in normal CLI output.
Does marking an output as sensitive keep it out of state (Terraform)?	No; it can still be stored in state, so you must protect state access.
What does `terraform output -json` provide?	Machine-readable JSON output for automation/scripts.
What’s a common workflow to verify outputs after adding them?	Run `terraform apply`, then query with `terraform output` (or `terraform output <name>`).
