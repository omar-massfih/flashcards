Terraform: what is a conditional expression used for?	Select one of two values based on a boolean condition.
What is the syntax of a conditional expression (Terraform)?	`condition ? true_val : false_val`.
How does `condition ? a : b` evaluate (Terraform)?	If `condition` is true, result is `a`; otherwise result is `b`.
Common use: how do conditional expressions define defaults (Terraform)?	Example: `var.a == "" ? "default-a" : var.a`.
What types of expressions usually appear in the condition part (Terraform)?	Any expression that evaluates to `bool` (often equality/comparison/logical operators).
Why add custom conditions in Terraform configs (high level)?	To capture assumptions and produce earlier, clearer error messages (e.g., in variable validation or pre/postconditions).
Conditional expressions: what constraint applies to the two result values (Terraform)?	They must have the same type, so Terraform can determine the expression’s result type.
If the two conditional result expressions have different types, what does Terraform do (Terraform)?	It attempts to find a type both can convert to and applies automatic conversions if possible.
Terraform recommendation: what should you do if the expected result type may be unclear?	Use explicit type conversion functions (e.g., `tostring(...)`) rather than relying on implicit conversion.
Example: how do you explicitly force a conditional to return a string (Terraform)?	`var.example ? tostring(12) : "hello"`.
Validation helper: how do you check membership in an allowed set (Terraform)?	`contains(["STAGE", "PROD"], var.environment)`.
Validation helper: how do you require a non-empty list/map (Terraform)?	`length(var.items) != 0`.
Why prefer `length(...)` checks over `== []` / `!= []` for empty collections (Terraform)?	Empty collection literals can be ambiguous in type; length-based checks express intent and avoid type-mismatch surprises.
Collection-wide validation pattern: how do you check a condition holds for all elements (Terraform)?	Use a for-expression + `alltrue([...])`, e.g. `alltrue([for v in var.instances : <bool expr>])`.
Collection-wide validation pattern: how do you check a condition holds for any element (Terraform)?	Use a for-expression + `anytrue([...])`.
What does `can(expr)` do in Terraform conditions?	Returns true if `expr` evaluates without error; false if evaluating it produces an error.
Example: how can `can` be used to validate a string with `regex` (Terraform)?	`can(regex("^[a-z]+$", var.name))` (because `regex` errors on non-match).
In conditions, what are `self`, `each`, and `count` used for (Terraform)?	`self` refers to attributes of the instance under evaluation in postcondition blocks; `each`/`count` refer to per-instance values inside blocks using `for_each`/`count`.
