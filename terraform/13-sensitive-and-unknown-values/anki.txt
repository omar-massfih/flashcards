Terraform sensitive attributes: what happens in plan output?	Terraform shows a placeholder (like `(sensitive value)`) instead of the actual value.
If you derive a value from a sensitive resource attribute, how does Terraform treat it?	It typically marks derived values as sensitive too (so they’re also hidden in plan/apply output).
If an output depends on a sensitive value, what must you do (Terraform)?	Mark the output itself as `sensitive = true` to confirm you intend to export it.
Does Terraform still store sensitive values in state?	Yes; sensitive values can be recorded in state in cleartext, so state access must be protected.
Terraform unknown values: what are they (high level)?	Placeholders for values Terraform can’t know during planning (until apply).
How do unknown values propagate in expressions (Terraform)?	Operations that combine known + unknown usually produce unknown results.
Where do unknown values show up in `terraform plan` output?	As `(known after apply)`.
Why can’t `count` be unknown (Terraform)?	Terraform must know the instance count during planning to build the graph and addresses.
What happens if a data source depends on unknown values (Terraform)?	It can’t be read during plan, so it’s deferred to apply and its results are unknown during planning.
If a module input variable value is unknown, what happens inside the child module?	References to that variable in the child module are unknown too.
If an output value is unknown, what happens for the parent module?	References to that output in the parent are unknown too.
When might type errors involving unknown values be detected (Terraform)?	Sometimes only at apply time, because full validation may be deferred until values are known.
