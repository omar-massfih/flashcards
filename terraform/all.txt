What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?	Managing infrastructure using configuration files instead of manual GUI/point-and-click changes.
What does IaC enable (core benefit list)?	Safe; consistent; repeatable infrastructure changes via versionable configuration.
Why is IaC “safer” than manual changes (in principle)?	Changes are explicit, reviewable, and reproducible from versioned config.
What is Terraform (in one sentence)?	HashiCorp’s IaC tool that defines infrastructure in declarative config files and manages its lifecycle.
What does “declarative configuration” mean (Terraform)?	You describe the desired end-state; Terraform determines the actions to reach it.
Terraform: what is a provider?	A plugin that lets Terraform interact with a platform/service via its API.
Terraform: what does a provider interact with?	Cloud platforms and services via their application programming interfaces (APIs).
Where do you find Terraform providers?	The Terraform Registry (and you can write your own if needed).
Terraform: what is a resource (conceptually)?	An individual unit of infrastructure managed by Terraform (e.g., compute instance, network).
Terraform: what is a module?	A reusable Terraform configuration composed from resources (possibly across providers).
Why are modules useful?	They let you reuse and standardize infrastructure patterns.
How does Terraform handle dependencies between resources?	It automatically calculates dependencies to create/destroy in the correct order.
Terraform workflow: what are the core steps?	Scope; Author; Initialize; Plan; Apply.
Terraform workflow: what does “Scope” mean?	Identify the infrastructure needed for the project.
Terraform workflow: what does “Author” mean?	Write the configuration that describes the desired infrastructure.
Terraform workflow: what does “Initialize” do?	Install the plugins/providers Terraform needs to manage infrastructure.
Terraform workflow: what does “Plan” do?	Preview the changes Terraform will make to match the configuration.
Terraform workflow: what does “Apply” do?	Make the planned changes to reach the desired state.
What is Terraform state (purpose)?	A state file that tracks real infrastructure and acts as a source of truth.
How does Terraform use state during deployments?	It compares desired config to state to decide what changes to make.
Why is version control valuable with Terraform configurations?	It enables safe collaboration and change tracking via code review and history.
What is a remote state backend used for?	To securely share state and coordinate access for team collaboration.
What problem do remote backends help prevent?	Race conditions when multiple people apply changes concurrently.
What is HCP Terraform used for (high level)?	Hosted Terraform that can share state, run Terraform in a stable environment, and support collaboration.
How can Terraform integrate with VCS (high level)?	Connect to GitHub/GitLab/etc. to propose infra changes when config changes are committed.
Terraform Azure prerequisite (account): what do you need?	An Azure subscription/account with permissions to create resources.
Terraform Azure prerequisite (tooling): what CLI is commonly used for auth?	The Azure CLI (used to authenticate locally).
What does `az login` do (Azure CLI)?	Authenticates you to Azure and lets CLI/Terraform use your account context.
How do you select the active Azure subscription in Azure CLI?	Use `az account set --subscription "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"`.
What is an Azure “service principal” in Terraform auth context?	An Azure AD application identity Terraform can use to authenticate and manage resources.
Why create a service principal for Terraform (Azure)?	To grant Terraform an identity with RBAC permissions to perform actions.
What does `az ad sp create-for-rbac` do (high level)?	Creates a service principal and assigns it an RBAC role over a given scope.
Security rule: what must you NOT do with service principal credentials?	Do not commit or share them (treat as secrets).
Azure provider auth (env vars): which `ARM_...` vars are commonly used?	`ARM_CLIENT_ID`; `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`; `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`; `ARM_TENANT_ID`.
How do you set Azure provider auth env vars in macOS/Linux shell?	Use `export ARM_CLIENT_ID="..."` etc.
Why prefer env vars over putting Azure credentials in Terraform config?	To reduce the chance of checking secrets into source control.
What is the purpose of the `terraform { ... }` block?	Terraform settings like required providers and Terraform CLI version constraints.
Where do you declare required providers in Terraform?	In `terraform { required_providers { ... } }`.
What does a provider `source` address like `hashicorp/azurerm` specify?	Which provider to install (from the Terraform Registry by default).
Why add a provider version constraint in `required_providers`?	To avoid unplanned upgrades that may introduce breaking changes.
What does the Terraform version constraint `required_version` do?	Prevents using Terraform CLI versions that don’t satisfy the constraint.
What does `~> 3.0.2` mean in a Terraform version constraint?	Allow `>= 3.0.2` and `< 3.1.0` (patch updates, not minor).
What is a Terraform `provider` block used for?	Configure a provider plugin (credentials, features, regions, etc.).
What is a Terraform `resource` block used for?	Declare an infrastructure object Terraform will manage.
Resource block structure (Terraform): what are the two strings after `resource`?	Resource type and resource name (e.g., `resource "TYPE" "NAME"`).
What is a Terraform resource address (format)?	`<resource_type>.<resource_name>` (e.g., `azurerm_resource_group.rg`).
What does `terraform init` do?	Initializes the working directory (downloads providers/modules; sets up backend).
What does `terraform plan` do?	Shows a preview of changes needed to reach the desired state.
What does `terraform apply` do?	Applies the planned changes to create/update/destroy infrastructure.
Why is it safe to abort at the `terraform apply` confirmation prompt?	No changes are made until you approve and proceed.
What does `terraform fmt` do?	Formats `.tf` files to canonical Terraform style.
What does `terraform validate` do?	Checks configuration syntax and internal consistency (without applying).
What file does Terraform use to record deployed infrastructure state by default?	`terraform.tfstate`.
Why must you protect `terraform.tfstate`?	It can contain sensitive data in plaintext; don’t share or commit it.
What does `terraform state list` do?	Lists resource addresses tracked in the current state.
