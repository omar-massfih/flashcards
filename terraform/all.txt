What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?	Managing infrastructure using configuration files instead of manual GUI/point-and-click changes.
What does IaC enable (core benefit list)?	Safe; consistent; repeatable infrastructure changes via versionable configuration.
Why is IaC “safer” than manual changes (in principle)?	Changes are explicit, reviewable, and reproducible from versioned config.
What is Terraform (in one sentence)?	HashiCorp’s IaC tool that defines infrastructure in declarative config files and manages its lifecycle.
What does “declarative configuration” mean (Terraform)?	You describe the desired end-state; Terraform determines the actions to reach it.
Terraform: what is a provider?	A plugin that lets Terraform interact with a platform/service via its API.
Terraform: what does a provider interact with?	Cloud platforms and services via their application programming interfaces (APIs).
Where do you find Terraform providers?	The Terraform Registry (and you can write your own if needed).
Terraform: what is a resource (conceptually)?	An individual unit of infrastructure managed by Terraform (e.g., compute instance, network).
Terraform: what is a module?	A reusable Terraform configuration composed from resources (possibly across providers).
Why are modules useful?	They let you reuse and standardize infrastructure patterns.
How does Terraform handle dependencies between resources?	It automatically calculates dependencies to create/destroy in the correct order.
Terraform workflow: what are the core steps?	Scope; Author; Initialize; Plan; Apply.
Terraform workflow: what does “Scope” mean?	Identify the infrastructure needed for the project.
Terraform workflow: what does “Author” mean?	Write the configuration that describes the desired infrastructure.
Terraform workflow: what does “Initialize” do?	Install the plugins/providers Terraform needs to manage infrastructure.
Terraform workflow: what does “Plan” do?	Preview the changes Terraform will make to match the configuration.
Terraform workflow: what does “Apply” do?	Make the planned changes to reach the desired state.
What is Terraform state (purpose)?	A state file that tracks real infrastructure and acts as a source of truth.
How does Terraform use state during deployments?	It compares desired config to state to decide what changes to make.
Why is version control valuable with Terraform configurations?	It enables safe collaboration and change tracking via code review and history.
What is a remote state backend used for?	To securely share state and coordinate access for team collaboration.
What problem do remote backends help prevent?	Race conditions when multiple people apply changes concurrently.
What is HCP Terraform used for (high level)?	Hosted Terraform that can share state, run Terraform in a stable environment, and support collaboration.
How can Terraform integrate with VCS (high level)?	Connect to GitHub/GitLab/etc. to propose infra changes when config changes are committed.
What is the purpose of the `terraform { ... }` block?	Terraform settings like required providers and Terraform CLI version constraints.
Where do you declare required providers in Terraform?	In `terraform { required_providers { ... } }`.
What does a provider `source` address like `hashicorp/azurerm` specify?	Which provider to install (from the Terraform Registry by default).
Why add a provider version constraint in `required_providers`?	To avoid unplanned upgrades that may introduce breaking changes.
What does the Terraform version constraint `required_version` do?	Prevents using Terraform CLI versions that don’t satisfy the constraint.
What does `~> 3.0.2` mean in a Terraform version constraint?	Allow `>= 3.0.2` and `< 3.1.0` (patch updates, not minor).
What is a Terraform `provider` block used for?	Configure a provider plugin (credentials, features, regions, etc.).
What is a Terraform `resource` block used for?	Declare an infrastructure object Terraform will manage.
Resource block structure (Terraform): what are the two strings after `resource`?	Resource type and resource name (e.g., `resource "TYPE" "NAME"`).
What is a Terraform resource address (format)?	`<resource_type>.<resource_name>` (e.g., `azurerm_resource_group.rg`).
What does `terraform init` do?	Initializes the working directory (downloads providers/modules; sets up backend).
What does `terraform plan` do?	Shows a preview of changes needed to reach the desired state.
What does `terraform apply` do?	Applies the planned changes to create/update/destroy infrastructure.
Why is it safe to abort at the `terraform apply` confirmation prompt?	No changes are made until you approve and proceed.
What does `terraform fmt` do?	Formats `.tf` files to canonical Terraform style.
What does `terraform validate` do?	Checks configuration syntax and internal consistency (without applying).
What file does Terraform use to record deployed infrastructure state by default?	`terraform.tfstate`.
Why must you protect `terraform.tfstate`?	It can contain sensitive data in plaintext; don’t share or commit it.
What does `terraform state list` do?	Lists resource addresses tracked in the current state.
What does it mean to “change infrastructure” in Terraform?	Edit configuration, then run `terraform apply` to create/update resources to match the new desired state.
How do you add a new resource in Terraform (conceptually)?	Add a new `resource "TYPE" "NAME" { ... }` block to your configuration.
How do you reference another resource’s attribute in Terraform config?	Use `<TYPE>.<NAME>.<ATTRIBUTE>` (e.g., `azurerm_resource_group.rg.name`).
What does referencing `azurerm_resource_group.rg.name` accomplish in another resource?	Uses the existing resource’s value and creates an implicit dependency between the resources.
Why does Terraform create a dependency graph?	To ensure resources are created/updated in a valid order based on references.
In Terraform plan output, what does `+ create` indicate?	A new resource will be created.
In Terraform plan output, what does `~ update in-place` indicate?	An existing resource will be modified without replacing it.
What does it mean to “update in-place” (Terraform)?	The resource is modified while keeping the same identity/address; it is not destroyed and recreated.
In plan output, what does “(known after apply)” mean?	The value is computed by the provider during apply and isn’t known at plan time.
What does “Refreshing state...” mean during `terraform apply`?	Terraform is reading current real-world resource data to synchronize state before planning/applying changes.
Why can adding a reference create an implicit dependency without `depends_on`?	Because Terraform can infer ordering from the expression graph (data flow) in configuration.
What Azure resource is added in this tutorial example?	An Azure virtual network resource (`azurerm_virtual_network`).
What is the purpose of `resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name` (Azure example)?	Places the VNet in the same resource group and ties its lifecycle ordering to the resource group.
What kind of value is `address_space` for an Azure VNet in Terraform?	A list of CIDR blocks (e.g., `["10.0.0.0/16"]`).
What does a CIDR block like `10.0.0.0/16` represent (high level)?	An IP address range; `/16` indicates the prefix length (network size).
Why should you avoid hardcoding values like `location` when they may differ by account/region?	Some regions may be unavailable; prefer configuration/variables when portability matters.
What does it mean that a new resource “references your resource group” (tutorial phrasing)?	The new resource’s arguments use values from the resource group, so Terraform orders creation accordingly.
After changing Terraform configuration, what command applies the change?	`terraform apply`.
What does the `tags` block do on a Terraform resource (Azure example)?	Assigns metadata key/value tags to the resource.
In HCL, what is the type/shape of `tags = { ... }`?	A map/object of keys to values (e.g., `Environment = "..."`).
Why are tags useful in cloud infrastructure?	They help with organization, ownership, environment labeling, and cost/accounting policies.
How does Terraform show tag additions in a plan?	As an in-place update (`~`) with new keys/values added under `tags`.
What’s the difference between creating a new resource vs modifying an existing one (Terraform)?	Create adds a new managed object; modify changes attributes of an existing managed object (often in-place).
What does the plan summary “Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy” mean?	Counts of create/change/destroy actions Terraform intends to take.
What does the plan summary “Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy” mean?	Terraform will update one existing resource and create/destroy none.
What does it mean that Terraform “only accepts ‘yes’” at the prompt?	`terraform apply` requires explicit confirmation before making changes.
What does the resource address `azurerm_virtual_network.vnet` identify?	The specific managed resource instance: `<TYPE>.<NAME>`.
What does `terraform show` help you verify after an apply?	It displays the current state values Terraform knows for managed resources (including updated tags).
Why might Terraform show `id = (known after apply)` during planning?	IDs are assigned by the provider/cloud when the resource is created.
What is the key mental model behind Terraform changes?	Terraform compares desired configuration to current tracked state and applies actions to converge them.
What does `terraform destroy` do?	Terminates (destroys) the resources managed by the current Terraform project/state.
Why destroy infrastructure when you no longer need it?	To reduce security exposure and costs (e.g., remove short-lived test/build environments).
What is `terraform destroy` the “inverse” of (Terraform)?	`terraform apply`: apply creates/updates; destroy removes managed infrastructure.
Does `terraform destroy` delete resources not managed by the current project?	No; it targets only the infrastructure tracked/managed by the current Terraform state.
What does `terraform destroy` use to decide what to terminate?	The current state (local `terraform.tfstate` or remote backend state, depending on setup).
What happens before Terraform destroys resources?	It generates an execution plan and asks for confirmation before making changes.
In destroy plan output, what does `- destroy` indicate?	That the resource instance will be destroyed.
In destroy plan output, what does `-> null` mean?	The attribute value will be removed because the resource is being destroyed.
What does “Refreshing state...” mean during `terraform destroy`?	Terraform reads current real-world resource data to sync state before planning/destruction.
What does the plan summary “Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, N to destroy” mean?	Terraform intends to destroy N resources and make no creates/updates.
Why does Terraform require typing `yes` to confirm destroy?	Destroy is irreversible (“no undo”), so Terraform requires explicit approval.
What warning does Terraform give before destroying managed infrastructure?	There is no undo; only `yes` is accepted to confirm.
Does Terraform destroy resources in arbitrary order?	No; it destroys in an order that respects dependencies.
Why does destroy order matter (Terraform)?	Dependent resources must be destroyed before the resources they depend on (e.g., destroy VNet before resource group).
How does Terraform figure out destroy order in complex setups?	It analyzes the dependency graph and chooses a suitable order.
What two Azure resources are shown being destroyed in the tutorial example?	`azurerm_virtual_network.vnet` and `azurerm_resource_group.rg`.
In the tutorial example, what plan symbol indicates the VNet will be destroyed?	`-` (destroy).
After destroy finishes, what does Terraform print (high level)?	A completion message summarizing how many resources were destroyed.
What does `terraform destroy` change besides cloud resources?	It updates Terraform state to reflect that managed resources no longer exist.
What’s a safe point to abort if something looks wrong during destroy?	At the confirmation prompt—no changes happen until you approve.
What is the key mental model behind `terraform destroy`?	Terraform compares desired actions to current state and then removes managed resources after approval.
How is destroy planning similar to apply planning?	Terraform shows an execution plan, uses refresh/state, and waits for approval before acting.
Why might you destroy a production environment (example from tutorial)?	If you remove it from service or rotate environments to limit risk/cost.
Why use input variables in Terraform?	To avoid hard-coded values and make configurations more flexible and reusable.
What is an input variable (Terraform)?	A named value you can set from outside the config (or via defaults) and reference as `var.<name>`.
Where do you commonly declare input variables (Terraform)?	In `.tf` files such as `variables.tf` using `variable "<name>" { ... }`.
What is the basic syntax of an input variable block (Terraform)?	`variable "name" { ... }`.
What does `default = "..."` do in a Terraform variable?	Makes the variable optional by providing a value when no input is given.
When is a Terraform variable required input?	When it has no `default` and no value is provided via other mechanisms.
How do you reference an input variable in Terraform configuration?	Use `var.<variable_name>` (e.g., `var.resource_group_name`).
In the tutorial, what does `name = var.resource_group_name` accomplish?	It uses the input variable value for the resource group name instead of a hard-coded string.
What file does the tutorial create to define `resource_group_name`?	`variables.tf`.
How do you override a variable value for a single run (Terraform)?	Pass it on the CLI, e.g. `terraform apply -var "resource_group_name=NewName"`.
Does `terraform apply -var ...` persist the value for future runs?	No; CLI-provided values are not saved automatically.
If CLI `-var` values aren’t saved, how do you avoid retyping them?	Use other mechanisms like `.tfvars` files or environment variables.
What is a `.tfvars` file used for (Terraform)?	To provide variable values from a file so you don’t have to pass them on the CLI each time.
What environment-variable naming pattern can set Terraform variables?	`TF_VAR_<variable_name>` (e.g., `TF_VAR_resource_group_name`).
In plan output, what does `-/+` mean?	Destroy and then create replacement (resource will be replaced).
What does “must be replaced” mean in Terraform plan output?	The resource cannot be updated in-place for the change, so Terraform will replace it.
What does “forces replacement” indicate in plan output?	That changing the attribute requires destroying and recreating the resource.
Why is renaming an Azure resource group described as a destructive update in the tutorial?	Changing its name forces replacement, so Terraform recreates the resource instead of updating it in-place.
Why can a dependent resource be replaced when its dependency is replaced?	Because it references attributes that change (e.g., `resource_group_name`), forcing it to be recreated too.
How does Terraform know which resources depend on others?	It infers dependencies from references like `azurerm_resource_group.rg.name` in other resources.
What does a plan showing both “to destroy” and “to add” often indicate?	Replacement: Terraform will destroy old instances and create new ones.
How do you tell replacement apart from in-place update in plan symbols?	`~` is update in-place; `-/+` is destroy then create replacement.
What does “known after apply” often indicate during replacement?	New IDs/values will be assigned when the replacement resource is created.
In HCL, what type of data structure is `tags = { ... }`?	A map/object of key/value pairs.
What is the key benefit of giving a variable a default value (Terraform)?	It lets config work without extra inputs while still allowing overrides.
Why should you be cautious about putting secrets in variable defaults?	Defaults can end up in code/version control; prefer secret-safe inputs (env vars/secret managers).
What’s a typical variable definition “shape” you’ll see in real configs?	`variable "x" { type = string; description = "..."; default = "..." }`.
When should you add a `type` to a Terraform variable?	When you want stronger validation and clearer intent (e.g., `string`, `list(string)`).
What does the plan summary “Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy” imply?	Terraform will replace resources (create new ones and destroy old ones).
What’s the mental model for variable-driven changes in Terraform?	Changing inputs changes desired state; Terraform plans actions (update/replace) to converge real infra to that state.
Why use output values in Terraform?	To avoid digging through many resource attributes by exposing only the values you care about.
What is an output value (Terraform)?	A declared value (in an `output` block) that Terraform records and can display/query for the user.
When does Terraform print output values?	After `terraform apply` completes (it prints an “Outputs” section).
How do you query saved outputs from the CLI (Terraform)?	Run `terraform output`.
How do you query a single output by name (Terraform)?	`terraform output <output_name>` (e.g., `terraform output resource_group_id`).
Where do you typically define outputs (Terraform)?	In `.tf` files (often `outputs.tf`), using `output "..." { ... }`.
What is the basic syntax of an output block (Terraform)?	`output "name" { value = <expression> }`.
What does the output block name represent (Terraform)?	The output variable’s name (the key users query with `terraform output`).
Why should output names follow Terraform identifier conventions?	So they can be referenced cleanly (e.g., as module outputs used by other configurations).
How do you set an output’s value (Terraform)?	With `value = <expression>` inside the output block.
How do you reference a resource attribute in an output (Terraform)?	Use `<TYPE>.<NAME>.<ATTRIBUTE>` (e.g., `azurerm_resource_group.rg.id`).
Example: output a resource group ID (Terraform Azure)?	`value = azurerm_resource_group.rg.id`.
Can you define multiple outputs (Terraform)?	Yes; you can add multiple `output` blocks.
Do outputs change real infrastructure by themselves (Terraform)?	No; they expose values—`apply` may update state/outputs without changing resources.
After adding an output to an already-applied config, what must you run to see it?	Re-run `terraform apply`.
In plan output, what does “Changes to Outputs:” mean?	Terraform will update which outputs are recorded in state and shown after apply.
Can `terraform apply` save new outputs without changing resources?	Yes; the plan can be `0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy` while outputs change.
Where are output values stored between runs (Terraform)?	In Terraform state (local `terraform.tfstate` or a remote backend state).
Why are outputs useful in complex configurations?	They surface a few important values from hundreds/thousands of tracked attributes.
How does a parent configuration reference a child module’s output (Terraform)?	`module.<module_name>.<output_name>`.
What does `sensitive = true` do for an output (Terraform)?	Marks the output as sensitive so Terraform suppresses it in normal CLI output.
Does marking an output as sensitive keep it out of state (Terraform)?	No; it can still be stored in state, so you must protect state access.
What does `terraform output -json` provide?	Machine-readable JSON output for automation/scripts.
What’s a common workflow to verify outputs after adding them?	Run `terraform apply`, then query with `terraform output` (or `terraform output <name>`).
Why store Terraform state remotely (production)?	To keep state secure/encrypted and enable team collaboration via shared state access.
What is HCP Terraform (high level)?	A hosted Terraform platform for collaboration (versioning/auditing runs), remote execution, and remote state storage.
Why run Terraform in a remote environment (HCP Terraform)?	It provides shared access to state and a stable environment for long-running Terraform operations.
How do you configure HCP Terraform in Terraform CLI workflow (HCL block)?	Use a `terraform { cloud { organization = "..."; workspaces { name = "..." } } }` block.
What is an HCP Terraform workspace (conceptually)?	A named context that holds state and run history for a configuration.
Why does the tutorial require Terraform `>= 1.1.0`?	The `cloud { ... }` block requires newer Terraform versions.
If `cloud { ... }` isn’t supported, what older alternative is mentioned?	Use the `remote` backend block to configure the CLI workflow and migrate state.
What does `terraform login` do (HCP Terraform)?	Authenticates the CLI to HCP Terraform by obtaining/storing an API token.
Where does `terraform login` store the HCP Terraform token?	In `~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` (stored in plain text).
Why should you protect `credentials.tfrc.json`?	It contains an API token; anyone with the file can access HCP Terraform as you.
After adding a `cloud` block, what Terraform command reinitializes and detects it?	`terraform init`.
During `terraform init`, what does “migrate your existing state” mean?	Copy the latest local state snapshot into the configured HCP Terraform workspace.
In the migration prompt, what does answering `yes` do?	Copies the local state snapshot to the HCP Terraform workspace.
In the migration prompt, what does answering `no` do?	Activates the configured HCP Terraform workspace without copying local state.
After migrating state to HCP Terraform, why delete the local `terraform.tfstate`?	To avoid keeping sensitive state on disk and to prevent using stale local state by mistake.
What is the default execution mode for HCP Terraform CLI-driven workflow?	Remote execution (Terraform operations run in HCP Terraform).
What does “local execution” mean with HCP Terraform (CLI-driven)?	Terraform runs locally but stores state remotely in HCP Terraform.
Where should you set Azure `ARM_...` auth variables when using HCP Terraform?	In the HCP Terraform workspace Variables UI (not only as local shell exports).
Which Azure auth value should be marked sensitive in HCP Terraform variables?	`ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`.
How do you create an Azure service principal for Terraform access (Azure CLI)?	`az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"`.
After migrating state, what does “No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.” indicate?	Terraform found no diffs between configuration and real resources, so no actions are needed.
What does the tutorial claim about how remote state is loaded when used?	Remote state is loaded only in memory when Terraform needs it.
What two main workflows does HCP Terraform support (names)?	VCS-driven workflow and API-driven workflow.
What triggers runs in an HCP Terraform VCS-driven workflow?	Commits/changes to the connected VCS repository queue plans/runs automatically.
Terraform language: what is HCL?	A configuration language Terraform’s native syntax is based on (also used by other HashiCorp tools).
Terraform config syntax: what are the two core constructs?	Arguments and blocks.
What is an argument in Terraform configuration syntax?	A name/value assignment like `image_id = "abc123"` where the value is an expression.
In an argument, what is the part before `=`?	The argument name (an identifier).
In an argument, what is the part after `=`?	An expression that produces the argument’s value.
What determines what value types an argument can accept?	The context/schema where the argument appears (e.g., a resource type’s argument schema).
Why does Terraform docs prefer the word “argument” over HCL’s “attribute”?	To avoid confusion with resource attributes like `id` that you can read but can’t assign in config.
What is a block in Terraform configuration syntax?	A container with a block type, optional labels, and a `{ ... }` body containing arguments and nested blocks.
What are “block labels” (Terraform/HCL)?	Quoted strings after the block type keyword that identify a particular instance (label count depends on block type).
How is a block body delimited in Terraform configuration?	With `{` and `}`.
Can blocks contain other blocks?	Yes; blocks can nest other blocks (and arguments) to form a hierarchy.
For a `resource` block, what are the two labels (high level)?	The resource type (provider-specific) and the resource’s local name (arbitrary within the module).
What is the purpose of the second label in `resource "TYPE" "NAME" { ... }`?	It uniquely names that instance so you can reference it (e.g., `TYPE.NAME`).
What are “top-level blocks” in Terraform?	Block types that can appear outside any other block; most Terraform features are implemented as top-level blocks.
Terraform syntax: can some nested blocks have zero labels?	Yes; some nested block types require no labels.
What is an identifier in Terraform configuration?	A name token used for argument names, block types, and Terraform constructs (resources, variables, etc.).
What characters can Terraform identifiers contain?	Letters; digits; underscores (`_`); hyphens (`-`).
What identifier rule avoids ambiguity with numbers?	The first character of an identifier must not be a digit.
What identifier character set does Terraform implement (high level)?	Unicode identifier syntax plus support for ASCII hyphen (`-`).
What comment styles are supported in Terraform config?	`#` single-line; `//` single-line; `/* ... */` multi-line.
Which comment style is idiomatic in Terraform?	`#` for single-line comments.
What might `terraform fmt` do to `//` comments?	It may rewrite them to `#` because `//` is not idiomatic.
What encoding must Terraform configuration files use?	UTF-8.
Which line endings does Terraform accept in `.tf` files?	LF or CRLF, but LF is idiomatic and tools may normalize to LF.
Does the resource label affect the real resource (Terraform)?	No; it’s only for Terraform state tracking and references (e.g., `TYPE.NAME`).
Terraform resource `TYPE`: where does it come from?	From a provider’s resource types (or the built-in `terraform_data` type).
What is `terraform_data` (Terraform)?	A built-in resource type that stores values and can trigger operations without creating real infrastructure.
Terraform resource meta-argument: what does `count` do?	Provisions multiple instances of the same resource from one block.
Can you use both `count` and `for_each` on the same resource (Terraform)?	No; they are mutually exclusive.
Terraform resource meta-argument: what does `for_each` do?	Provisions multiple instances from one block, one per element in a map or set.
What kinds of values can `for_each` take (Terraform)?	A map or a set of strings.
Terraform resource meta-argument: what does `depends_on` do?	Forces Terraform to complete operations on listed upstream references before operating on this resource.
Terraform resource meta-argument: what does `provider` do?	Selects a specific provider configuration (alias) to use for that resource.
How do you point a resource at an aliased provider config (Terraform)?	Set `provider = <PROVIDER>.<ALIAS>` inside the resource block.
What is the purpose of `lifecycle { ... }` on a resource (Terraform)?	Defines lifecycle rules controlling create/update/replace/destroy behavior.
Terraform lifecycle: what does `create_before_destroy` do?	Creates the replacement resource before destroying the current one.
Terraform lifecycle: what does `prevent_destroy` do?	Makes Terraform error if a plan would destroy the resource.
Does `prevent_destroy` protect a resource if you remove its configuration (Terraform)?	No; removing the block removes the rule, so Terraform can plan to destroy it.
Terraform lifecycle: what does `ignore_changes` do?	Tells Terraform to ignore diffs for listed attributes and not try to update them.
Terraform lifecycle: what does `replace_triggered_by` do?	Forces replacement when the referenced resources/attributes change.
Terraform lifecycle: what is a `precondition`?	A condition that must be true before creating the resource; otherwise Terraform errors with `error_message`.
Terraform lifecycle: what is a `postcondition`?	A condition checked after creating the resource; otherwise Terraform errors with `error_message`.
What values are allowed inside a `lifecycle` block (Terraform)?	Only literal values (Terraform processes lifecycle rules before evaluating arbitrary expressions).
Terraform language: what is an expression?	Syntax that produces a value in configuration (e.g., literals, references, operators, conditionals, function calls).
What is the simplest kind of Terraform expression?	A literal value (e.g., `"hello"` or `5`).
What can Terraform expressions do besides literal values?	Reference values; do arithmetic; conditional evaluation; call built-in functions.
What is a reference expression (Terraform)?	An expression that reads a value exported elsewhere (e.g., `var.<name>` or `<TYPE>.<NAME>.<ATTRIBUTE>`).
Why can’t every Terraform expression be used everywhere?	Some contexts restrict expressions (e.g., require a literal value of a particular type or forbid certain references).
Example restriction: what might a context require from an expression (Terraform)?	A literal value of a particular type (not an arbitrary computed expression).
Example restriction: what might a context forbid in an expression (Terraform)?	References to certain values (e.g., resource attributes), depending on the language feature.
What command opens Terraform’s expression console?	`terraform console`
What is `terraform console` used for (Terraform)?	To experiment with and evaluate expressions interactively.
Terraform expressions: what does an expression evaluate to?	A value (and every value has a type).
Terraform values: what does a value’s type determine?	Where the value can be used and what transformations/conversions apply.
Terraform type: what is `string`?	Unicode text, like `"hello"`.
Terraform type: what is `number`?	A numeric value (can represent whole numbers and fractional values).
Terraform type: what is `bool`?	A boolean value: `true` or `false`.
Terraform type: what is `list`/`tuple` (high level)?	An ordered sequence you index with whole numbers starting at 0 (e.g., `["a", 15, true]`).
Terraform type: what is `set` (high level)?	An unordered collection of unique values (no stable index ordering).
Terraform type: what is `map`/`object` (high level)?	Values identified by string keys/labels, like `{ name = "Mabel", age = 52 }`.
Terraform types: what are “primitive” vs “complex/collection” types?	Primitive: `string`, `number`, `bool`; complex/collection: lists/tuples, maps/objects (and `set` as a collection type).
What special value has no type in Terraform?	`null`.
What does `null` mean in Terraform configuration?	Absence/omission: setting an argument to `null` behaves as if the argument were omitted.
If you set an argument to `null`, what does Terraform do with defaults/required args?	It uses the argument’s default if it has one; otherwise it errors if the argument is required.
Why is `null` especially useful in Terraform expressions?	To conditionally omit an argument when a condition isn’t met.
What is a literal expression (Terraform)?	An expression that directly represents a constant value.
Terraform literal: how do you write a boolean literal?	`true` or `false` (unquoted).
Terraform literal: how do you write the `null` literal?	`null` (unquoted).
Terraform literal: how do you write a list/tuple literal?	`[value1, value2, ...]` (commas required; multiline allowed; trailing comma allowed).
Why can’t you index directly into a `set` in Terraform?	Sets are unordered, so Terraform doesn’t support element access by numeric index.
How do you access a set element “by index” in Terraform (pattern)?	Convert to a list first (e.g., `tolist(var.example_set)[0]`).
Terraform literal: how do you write a map/object literal?	`{ key = value, ... }` (pairs can be separated by commas or line breaks).
In a Terraform map/object literal, what are the rules for keys (high level)?	Keys must be strings; they can be unquoted if valid identifiers, otherwise quoted; non-literal keys can be written as `(expr) = value`.
How do you access list/tuple elements vs map/object elements in Terraform expressions?	`seq[3]` uses a whole-number index; `map["key"]` uses a string key.
When can you use dot-attribute notation on a map/object (Terraform)?	When the attribute name is a valid identifier (e.g., `local.object.attrname`).
Terraform style: when should you prefer bracket indexing over dot notation for maps?	When keys may be arbitrary user-provided strings (use `local.map["keyname"]`).
Terraform docs: when do “list vs tuple” and “map vs object” distinctions matter?	Usually they behave identically; distinctions mainly matter for type constraints/validation (module/provider authors).
Terraform type conversion: when does Terraform automatically convert types?	When an argument expects a type and the given expression can be converted to it.
Terraform type conversion: when does automatic conversion NOT occur?	When using the equality operator.
What automatic string conversions does Terraform perform (examples)?	It converts `number`/`bool` to `string` when needed (`15` ↔ `"15"`; `true` ↔ `"true"`) and can parse valid strings into numbers/bools.
Terraform strings: what is a quoted string literal?	A sequence of characters delimited by double quotes, e.g. `"hello"`.
Terraform quoted strings: what does `\\n` represent?	A newline character.
Terraform quoted strings: what does `\\r` represent?	A carriage return character.
Terraform quoted strings: what does `\\t` represent?	A tab character.
Terraform quoted strings: what does `\\\"` represent?	A literal `"` (quote) without ending the string.
Terraform quoted strings: what does `\\\\` represent?	A literal backslash (`\\`).
Terraform quoted strings: what does `\\uNNNN` represent?	A Unicode character from the basic multilingual plane (4 hex digits).
Terraform quoted strings: what does `\\UNNNNNNNN` represent?	A Unicode character from supplementary planes (8 hex digits).
Terraform strings: how do you write a literal `${` in a string?	Use `$${` (so it doesn’t start an interpolation).
Terraform strings: how do you write a literal `%{` in a string?	Use `%%{` (so it doesn’t start a directive).
Terraform strings: what is a heredoc string?	A multiline string literal introduced with `<<DELIM` (or `<<-DELIM`) and ended by `DELIM` on its own line.
Terraform heredoc: what does the delimiter word do?	It marks where the heredoc ends (Terraform reads lines until a line that exactly matches the delimiter).
Terraform heredoc: what does `<<-` mean (indented heredoc)?	Terraform trims common leading spaces from all lines (based on the least-indented line in the heredoc).
Terraform heredoc: are backslash escapes interpreted?	No; backslashes are treated literally in heredocs.
Terraform tip: should you use heredocs to generate JSON/YAML?	No; prefer `jsonencode(...)` / `yamlencode(...)` to guarantee valid syntax.
Terraform templates: what sequences start template processing inside strings?	`${` starts interpolation; `%{` starts a directive.
Terraform interpolation: what does `${ ... }` do?	Evaluates the expression, converts the result to a string if needed, and inserts it into the string.
Terraform directives: what does `%{ ... }` enable?	Conditionals and iteration over collections to build strings.
Terraform directive: what is the `%{if ...}` / `%{else}` / `%{endif}` pattern?	Choose between templates based on a boolean expression (the else is optional).
Terraform `%{if}` directive: what happens if there is no `else` and the condition is false?	It produces an empty string for that directive block.
Terraform directive: what is the `%{for name in collection}` / `%{endfor}` pattern?	Iterate over elements and concatenate the rendered template for each element.
Terraform templates: what is the strip marker `~` for?	Whitespace stripping: it consumes literal whitespace (spaces/newlines) before or after a template sequence to avoid unwanted output.
Terraform style: when should you prefer heredocs vs quoted strings for templates?	Use heredocs for directives (multi-line templates); quoted strings are usually best for simple interpolations.
