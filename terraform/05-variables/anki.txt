Why use input variables in Terraform?	To avoid hard-coded values and make configurations more flexible and reusable.
What is an input variable (Terraform)?	A named value you can set from outside the config (or via defaults) and reference as `var.<name>`.
Where do you commonly declare input variables (Terraform)?	In `.tf` files such as `variables.tf` using `variable "<name>" { ... }`.
What is the basic syntax of an input variable block (Terraform)?	`variable "name" { ... }`.
What does `default = "..."` do in a Terraform variable?	Makes the variable optional by providing a value when no input is given.
When is a Terraform variable required input?	When it has no `default` and no value is provided via other mechanisms.
How do you reference an input variable in Terraform configuration?	Use `var.<variable_name>` (e.g., `var.resource_group_name`).
In the tutorial, what does `name = var.resource_group_name` accomplish?	It uses the input variable value for the resource group name instead of a hard-coded string.
What file does the tutorial create to define `resource_group_name`?	`variables.tf`.
How do you override a variable value for a single run (Terraform)?	Pass it on the CLI, e.g. `terraform apply -var "resource_group_name=NewName"`.
Does `terraform apply -var ...` persist the value for future runs?	No; CLI-provided values are not saved automatically.
If CLI `-var` values aren’t saved, how do you avoid retyping them?	Use other mechanisms like `.tfvars` files or environment variables.
What is a `.tfvars` file used for (Terraform)?	To provide variable values from a file so you don’t have to pass them on the CLI each time.
What environment-variable naming pattern can set Terraform variables?	`TF_VAR_<variable_name>` (e.g., `TF_VAR_resource_group_name`).
In plan output, what does `-/+` mean?	Destroy and then create replacement (resource will be replaced).
What does “must be replaced” mean in Terraform plan output?	The resource cannot be updated in-place for the change, so Terraform will replace it.
What does “forces replacement” indicate in plan output?	That changing the attribute requires destroying and recreating the resource.
Why is renaming an Azure resource group described as a destructive update in the tutorial?	Changing its name forces replacement, so Terraform recreates the resource instead of updating it in-place.
Why can a dependent resource be replaced when its dependency is replaced?	Because it references attributes that change (e.g., `resource_group_name`), forcing it to be recreated too.
How does Terraform know which resources depend on others?	It infers dependencies from references like `azurerm_resource_group.rg.name` in other resources.
What does a plan showing both “to destroy” and “to add” often indicate?	Replacement: Terraform will destroy old instances and create new ones.
How do you tell replacement apart from in-place update in plan symbols?	`~` is update in-place; `-/+` is destroy then create replacement.
What does “known after apply” often indicate during replacement?	New IDs/values will be assigned when the replacement resource is created.
In HCL, what type of data structure is `tags = { ... }`?	A map/object of key/value pairs.
What is the key benefit of giving a variable a default value (Terraform)?	It lets config work without extra inputs while still allowing overrides.
Why should you be cautious about putting secrets in variable defaults?	Defaults can end up in code/version control; prefer secret-safe inputs (env vars/secret managers).
What’s a typical variable definition “shape” you’ll see in real configs?	`variable "x" { type = string; description = "..."; default = "..." }`.
When should you add a `type` to a Terraform variable?	When you want stronger validation and clearer intent (e.g., `string`, `list(string)`).
What does the plan summary “Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy” imply?	Terraform will replace resources (create new ones and destroy old ones).
What’s the mental model for variable-driven changes in Terraform?	Changing inputs changes desired state; Terraform plans actions (update/replace) to converge real infra to that state.
