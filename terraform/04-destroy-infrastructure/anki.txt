What does `terraform destroy` do?	Terminates (destroys) the resources managed by the current Terraform project/state.
Why destroy infrastructure when you no longer need it?	To reduce security exposure and costs (e.g., remove short-lived test/build environments).
What is `terraform destroy` the “inverse” of (Terraform)?	`terraform apply`: apply creates/updates; destroy removes managed infrastructure.
Does `terraform destroy` delete resources not managed by the current project?	No; it targets only the infrastructure tracked/managed by the current Terraform state.
What does `terraform destroy` use to decide what to terminate?	The current state (local `terraform.tfstate` or remote backend state, depending on setup).
What happens before Terraform destroys resources?	It generates an execution plan and asks for confirmation before making changes.
In destroy plan output, what does `- destroy` indicate?	That the resource instance will be destroyed.
In destroy plan output, what does `-> null` mean?	The attribute value will be removed because the resource is being destroyed.
What does “Refreshing state...” mean during `terraform destroy`?	Terraform reads current real-world resource data to sync state before planning/destruction.
What does the plan summary “Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, N to destroy” mean?	Terraform intends to destroy N resources and make no creates/updates.
Why does Terraform require typing `yes` to confirm destroy?	Destroy is irreversible (“no undo”), so Terraform requires explicit approval.
What warning does Terraform give before destroying managed infrastructure?	There is no undo; only `yes` is accepted to confirm.
Does Terraform destroy resources in arbitrary order?	No; it destroys in an order that respects dependencies.
Why does destroy order matter (Terraform)?	Dependent resources must be destroyed before the resources they depend on (e.g., destroy VNet before resource group).
How does Terraform figure out destroy order in complex setups?	It analyzes the dependency graph and chooses a suitable order.
What two Azure resources are shown being destroyed in the tutorial example?	`azurerm_virtual_network.vnet` and `azurerm_resource_group.rg`.
In the tutorial example, what plan symbol indicates the VNet will be destroyed?	`-` (destroy).
After destroy finishes, what does Terraform print (high level)?	A completion message summarizing how many resources were destroyed.
What does `terraform destroy` change besides cloud resources?	It updates Terraform state to reflect that managed resources no longer exist.
What’s a safe point to abort if something looks wrong during destroy?	At the confirmation prompt—no changes happen until you approve.
What is the key mental model behind `terraform destroy`?	Terraform compares desired actions to current state and then removes managed resources after approval.
How is destroy planning similar to apply planning?	Terraform shows an execution plan, uses refresh/state, and waits for approval before acting.
Why might you destroy a production environment (example from tutorial)?	If you remove it from service or rotate environments to limit risk/cost.
