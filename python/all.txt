What is the Python Data Model?	The set of protocols (special methods) that let objects support core language features and idiomatic syntax.
What are “special methods” in Python?	Methods with `__double_underscores__` that the interpreter calls to implement language features.
What does “dunder” mean?	“Double underscore” (before and after a name), e.g., `__len__`.
What does `obj[key]` use under the hood?	`obj.__getitem__(key)`
What does `len(obj)` use under the hood?	`obj.__len__()`
Should user code call special methods directly?	Usually no; prefer the related built-ins/syntax (e.g., `len(x)`, `iter(x)`, `str(x)`).
Why prefer built-ins over calling special methods directly?	Built-ins can add behavior and may be faster (especially for built-in types).
How does `for x in obj:` start iteration?	It calls `iter(obj)`, which uses `obj.__iter__()` or may fall back to `obj.__getitem__()`.
What two special methods are enough to make an object behave like a basic sequence?	`__len__` and `__getitem__`.
What features do `__len__` + `__getitem__` typically enable?	`len()`; indexing; slicing; iteration.
How can implementing standard protocols help you use the standard library?	Stdlib functions that expect those protocols can work without custom adapters (e.g., choosing an item from a sequence).
How does `x in collection` work if `__contains__` is missing?	It can do a sequential scan using iteration.
What is `__repr__` for?	Unambiguous representation for debugging/inspection; used by `repr()` and typically by the interactive console.
What is `__str__` for?	User-friendly display string; used by `str()` and `print()`.
If you implement only one, prefer `__repr__` or `__str__`?	`__repr__`.
What’s a good rule of thumb for `__repr__`?	Make it unambiguous; if possible, make it resemble code to recreate the object.
How do you force `repr` formatting in an f-string?	Use `!r`, e.g. ``f"{x!r}"``.
What does `abs(obj)` use under the hood?	`obj.__abs__()`
Which operator corresponds to `__add__`?	`+` (e.g., `a + b` triggers `a.__add__(b)`).
Which operator corresponds to `__mul__`?	`*` (e.g., `a * b` triggers `a.__mul__(b)`).
What’s the expected behavior of infix operators for user-defined types?	They usually return a new object and don’t mutate the operands.
What special method controls truthiness?	`__bool__`
If `__bool__` isn’t defined, what does Python use for truthiness?	`__len__` (zero → falsy; nonzero → truthy).
If neither `__bool__` nor `__len__` is defined, are instances truthy?	Yes; instances are truthy by default.
What must `__bool__` return?	A Boolean (`True` or `False`).
Why is `len(x)` not `x.len()` in Python (design rationale)?	`len` is a language-level operation optimized for built-ins, and user types participate via `__len__`.
Data model benefit for users of your class?	They use standard syntax for standard operations instead of memorizing custom method names.
Data model benefit for authors of classes?	Your objects “plug into” core features and the standard library by implementing the right special methods.
What warning does Python give about using `__*__` names?	Don’t invent/abuse `__*__` names outside documented uses; they may break without warning.
Why does Python treat many types uniformly as sequences (historical)?	It inherited ideas from ABC: generic operations across different sequence types.
What common operations do many Python sequences share?	Iteration; slicing; sorting; concatenation (across types like `str`, `list`, `bytes`, arrays, etc.).
What is a container sequence (Python)?	A sequence that holds references to contained objects (can be heterogeneous and nested).
What is a flat sequence (Python)?	A sequence that stores simple values in its own memory (typically one primitive machine type).
Why are flat sequences usually more memory-efficient than container sequences?	They store packed values (fewer separate Python objects/headers and references).
Give examples of mutable sequences (Python).	`list`; `bytearray`; `array.array`; `collections.deque`.
Give examples of immutable sequences (Python).	`tuple`; `str`; `bytes`.
What is a list comprehension (Python)?	An expression that builds a new list by transforming and/or filtering an iterable.
Why can a list comprehension be clearer than a for-loop when building a list?	Its intent is explicit: it always builds a new list (a for-loop can do many tasks).
When should you avoid using a list comprehension (Python)?	When you only want side effects and don’t use the resulting list—use a plain `for` loop instead.
Python syntax tip: why can list/dict/tuple literals and comps be multiline without backslashes?	Line breaks are ignored inside `[]`, `{}`, or `()`.
Listcomps vs `map`/`filter`: why often prefer list comprehensions (Python)?	They’re usually more readable and avoid awkward `lambda` usage while doing the same job.
Do list comprehension loop variables leak in Python 3?	No; comprehension variables have their own local scope (they don’t clobber outer names).
How do you build a Cartesian product with a list comprehension?	Use multiple `for` clauses, e.g. `[(c, s) for c in colors for s in sizes]`.
What is a generator expression (Python)?	A comprehension-like expression that yields items lazily via the iterator protocol (no intermediate list).
Why use a generator expression instead of a list comprehension to feed another constructor/loop?	It saves memory by producing items one at a time.
When can you omit parentheses around a generator expression in a function call?	When it’s the only positional argument (e.g., `tuple(x for x in it)`).
When are parentheses around a generator expression required?	When the call has other arguments too (e.g., `array('I', (x for x in it))`).
Tuples: what two roles do they play (Python)?	Records with positional fields, and immutable lists.
Why are tuples useful as records (Python)?	Field order/length is fixed; unpacking avoids error-prone indexing.
Tuple-as-immutable-list: what clarity does using a tuple provide?	Seeing a tuple signals its length won’t change.
Why can tuples be smaller/faster than lists (high level)?	Fixed-size allocation and less overhead enable optimizations compared to growable lists.
Why can a tuple’s value still change even though tuples are “immutable”?	If it contains references to mutable objects, those objects can mutate.
When is a tuple hashable, and how can you quickly check?	Only if all items are hashable; `hash(t)` raises `TypeError` if it contains mutable/unhashable items.
What is iterable unpacking (Python)?	Assigning items from an iterable into multiple variables without indexing (works with iterators too).
How do you swap two variables idiomatically (Python)?	`a, b = b, a`.
How do you pass a tuple as separate positional arguments (Python)?	Use `*t` in the call, e.g. `divmod(*t)`.
In unpacking assignment, what does `*rest` do?	It captures any remaining items into a list.
How many starred targets like `*rest` are allowed in one unpacking assignment?	At most one.
Where can the starred target appear in unpacking assignment?	At the start, middle, or end.
What is nested unpacking (Python)?	Unpacking nested structures by matching the nesting shape on the left-hand side.
How can unpacking assert an iterable has exactly one item (Python)?	Use a 1-item target like `[record] = iterable` (it raises if not exactly one).
What is structural pattern matching used for (Python ≥ 3.10)?	Matching data shapes and destructuring (binding parts) with `match`/`case`.
When does a sequence pattern match in `match`/`case` (Python)?	The subject is a sequence; pattern and subject lengths match; corresponding items (including nested) match.
In `match`/`case` patterns, what does `_` mean (Python)?	A wildcard that matches anything and is never bound to a value.
In a sequence pattern, what does `*rest` (or `*_`) do (Python)?	`*rest` matches remaining items and binds them as a list; `*_` matches and ignores them.
Are `str`, `bytes`, and `bytearray` treated as sequences in match/case patterns?	No; they’re treated as atomic values to avoid unintended matches.
What is a guard in `match`/`case` (Python)?	An `if` condition that is evaluated only after the pattern matches.
Why do Python slices/ranges exclude the stop index?	It makes lengths easy (`stop-start`) and allows clean splits like `s[:x]` and `s[x:]` without overlap.
What does the slice step/stride do (Python)?	`seq[a:b:c]` skips by `c`; negative steps iterate in reverse.
What does `seq[start:stop:step]` call under the hood (Python)?	`seq.__getitem__(slice(start, stop, step))`.
How can naming `slice()` objects improve readability (Python)?	It lets you label fixed-width fields/ranges instead of scattering hardcoded indices.
Slice assignment (Python): what must the RHS be, and what extra rule applies with a step?	RHS must be an iterable (even for one item); for stepped slices, RHS length must match the number of selected positions.
Do `+` and `*` mutate their sequence operands (Python)?	No; they create a new sequence and don’t change the originals.
Why is `[[...]] * n` (or `[['_']*m] * n`) a common bug pattern (Python)?	It repeats references to the same inner list, so one mutation affects multiple “rows”.
What’s the safe way to build a list of independent inner lists (Python)?	Use a list comprehension, e.g. `[['_']*m for _ in range(n)]`.
What determines whether `a += b` mutates in place (Python)?	If `__iadd__` exists it’s used (often in-place for mutables); otherwise Python falls back to `a = a + b` (new object).
Why can `t[2] += [...]` be surprising when `t` is a tuple containing a list?	It may mutate the inner list, then raise `TypeError` when trying to store back into the tuple (augmented assignment isn’t atomic).
`list.sort()` vs `sorted()` (Python): what’s the difference?	`list.sort()` sorts in place and returns `None`; `sorted()` returns a new list from any iterable.
What do `key=` and `reverse=` do in sorting (Python), and what does “stable” mean?	`key` computes sort keys; `reverse=True` reverses order; stable means equal keys keep their original relative order.
When is `array.array` a better choice than `list` (Python)?	When you need large homogeneous numeric data and want lower memory overhead.
What does an `array` typecode specify (Python)?	The underlying C storage type for items (and it restricts what values you can store).
What is `memoryview` used for (Python)?	To share/slice binary or numeric data without copying bytes (a shared-memory view).
Why use `collections.deque` for a FIFO queue instead of a list?	`deque` supports fast append/pop from both ends; `list.pop(0)` is costly because it shifts elements.
What happens when you append to a bounded `deque` that is full (Python)?	It discards an item from the opposite end to make room.
Why are dicts so fundamental in Python (implementation)?	Class/instance attributes, module namespaces, and function keyword arguments are represented with dictionaries in memory.
Where are Python built-ins stored (CPython, high level)?	In `__builtins__.__dict__` (a dict holding built-in types/objects/functions).
What data structure underlies Python `dict` (high level)?	A hash table.
Which built-in types are also based on hash tables (Python)?	`set` and `frozenset` (and `dict` itself).
What is a dict comprehension (Python)?	An expression that builds a `dict` from an iterable of key/value data (key: value pairs).
What does a dict comprehension look like (Python syntax)?	`{k: v for ...}` (optionally with `if` filters).
What does mapping unpacking with `**` do in a function call (Python)?	It expands a mapping into keyword arguments (e.g., `f(**d)`).
What restriction applies to mapping unpacking (`**`) in function calls (Python)?	Expanded keys must be strings, and duplicate keyword arguments are not allowed.
What does `**` do inside a dict literal (Python ≥ 3.5)?	It unpacks another mapping into the new dict (e.g., `{**d1, **d2}`).
In a dict literal with multiple `**` unpackings, what happens with duplicate keys (Python)?	Later occurrences overwrite earlier ones.
How do you merge two dicts with `|` (Python ≥ 3.9)?	`d3 = d1 | d2` creates a new mapping with keys from both (right operand wins on conflicts).
How do you merge dicts in place with `|=` (Python ≥ 3.9)?	`d1 |= d2` updates `d1` in place with items from `d2`.
In `d1 | d2`, which values win if keys overlap (Python)?	The right operand’s values (from `d2`) overwrite.
Pattern matching: what can mapping patterns match (Python ≥ 3.10)?	Instances of actual or virtual subclasses of `collections.abc.Mapping`.
Do mapping patterns care about key order (Python match/case)?	No; key order in the pattern is irrelevant (even if the subject is an `OrderedDict`).
Do mapping patterns require an exact match of all keys (Python match/case)?	No; mapping patterns succeed on partial matches (extra keys in the subject are allowed).
How can you capture extra key/value pairs in a mapping pattern (Python match/case)?	Use `**rest` to bind remaining items as a dict (`**rest` must be last).
In mapping pattern matching, does `defaultdict` create missing keys to satisfy a pattern?	No; pattern matching checks existing keys only (it uses `d.get(key, sentinel)`).
What are `Mapping` and `MutableMapping` in Python?	ABCs in `collections.abc` that formalize mapping interfaces (useful for `isinstance` checks).
Why prefer `isinstance(x, abc.Mapping)` over `type(x) is dict` (Python)?	It supports alternative mapping types, not just the concrete `dict`.
What does it mean for a key to be “hashable” (Python)?	It has a hash code that doesn’t change during its lifetime and supports equality comparison (`__hash__` + `__eq__`).
What must be true of equal hashable objects (Python)?	If `a == b`, then `hash(a) == hash(b)`.
Which common types are hashable by default (Python examples)?	Numbers, `str`, and `bytes` (flat immutable types).
When is a container type hashable (Python)?	If it’s immutable and all contained items are hashable (e.g., certain tuples).
Why is `frozenset` always hashable (Python)?	Because it can contain only hashable elements.
When is a `tuple` hashable (Python)?	Only if all its items are hashable (e.g., a tuple containing a list is unhashable).
Are hash codes stable across Python runs (CPython)?	Not necessarily; hashing is salted for security, so hash codes are only guaranteed stable within one process.
Why can a custom `__eq__` make hashability tricky (Python)?	To remain hashable, `__hash__` must stay consistent with `__eq__` and depend only on immutable state.
What is `dict.get(k, default)` for (Python)?	Fetching `d[k]` with a default instead of raising `KeyError` when `k` is missing.
Why can `dict.get` be suboptimal when updating a mutable value (Python)?	You may do a lookup, mutate, then do another lookup/store back—extra work and easy to write awkwardly.
What does `dict.setdefault(k, default)` do (Python)?	If `k` exists, returns `d[k]`; otherwise sets `d[k] = default` and returns it.
Why is `d.setdefault(k, []).append(x)` idiomatic (Python)?	It ensures a list exists at `k` with a single lookup, then appends.
What is `collections.defaultdict` (Python)?	A dict-like mapping that creates a default value on missing `d[k]` lookups using a `default_factory`.
What does `defaultdict.default_factory` do (Python)?	It’s a callable used to create and insert a default value when `__getitem__` sees a missing key.
When does a `defaultdict` call `default_factory` (Python)?	Only on `d[k]` lookups via `__getitem__`, not on `d.get(k)` or `k in d`.
What is the `__missing__` method for (Python mappings)?	A hook a `dict` subclass can define; `dict.__getitem__` calls it when a key is missing.
Does `k in d` trigger `__missing__` in a `dict` subclass (Python)?	No; membership tests don’t fall back to `__missing__` unless you implement that logic yourself.
Why must a `__missing__` implementation often special-case string keys (Python example)?	To avoid infinite recursion when `__missing__` retries lookup using a transformed key.
Why is subclassing `collections.UserDict` often easier than subclassing `dict` (Python)?	UserDict uses composition (`self.data`), avoiding some built-in shortcuts that can make subclassing `dict` tricky.
What is `types.MappingProxyType` (Python)?	A wrapper that provides a read-only, dynamic proxy view of an underlying mapping.
Is a `mappingproxy` (from `MappingProxyType`) a snapshot (Python)?	No; it’s dynamic—changes to the original mapping are reflected in the proxy.
What do `dict.keys()`, `dict.items()`, and `dict.values()` return (Python 3)?	View objects (`dict_keys`, `dict_items`, `dict_values`) that are dynamic projections.
Are dict view objects subscriptable (Python)?	No; they’re iterable and sized, but you can’t do `values[0]`.
Which dict views behave like sets (Python)?	`dict_keys` and `dict_items` support set operations like `&`, `|`, `-`, `^`.
When do set operations on `dict_items` fail (Python)?	If any value is unhashable (because items are `(key, value)` pairs that must be hashable).
How can dict key insertion order matter (Python ≥ 3.7)?	Iteration preserves insertion order as a language feature (implementation detail since CPython 3.6).
What is `collections.OrderedDict` mainly used for today (Python)?	Backward compatibility and cases needing its extra reordering operations.
How does `OrderedDict` equality differ from `dict` (Python)?	`OrderedDict` equality checks both keys/values and order.
What does `OrderedDict.move_to_end(k)` do (Python)?	Repositions an existing key to one end (useful for LRU-like logic).
What is `collections.ChainMap` (Python)?	A wrapper that searches multiple mappings in order as if they were one.
Where do updates go in a `ChainMap` (Python)?	Assignments/updates affect only the first (leftmost) mapping.
What is `collections.Counter` (Python)?	A mapping from keys to integer counts (useful for frequency counting / multiset behavior).
What does `Counter.update(iterable)` do (Python)?	It adds counts for elements from the iterable (instead of overwriting like `dict.update`).
What is a `set` in Python?	A collection of unique, hashable elements.
How do you create an empty set literal in Python?	You can’t; use `set()` because `{}` is an empty dict.
Why are set literals like `{1, 2, 3}` preferred over `set([1, 2, 3])` (Python)?	They’re more readable and avoid building an intermediate list (often faster).
Is there a `frozenset` literal syntax in Python?	No; create one with `frozenset(...)`.
What is a set comprehension (Python)?	An expression that builds a set: `{expr for ...}` (optionally with `if` filters).
What do the main set operators mean (Python)?	Union `|`; intersection `&`; difference `-`; symmetric difference `^`.
Do set infix operators like `a & b` accept any iterables (Python)?	No; infix operators require sets on both sides (methods like `.intersection(...)` accept iterables).
How can you remove duplicates while preserving first-seen order (Python ≥ 3.7)?	Use a dict: `list(dict.fromkeys(items))` (dict preserves insertion order).
Why is set membership testing fast (Python)?	Hash table lookup finds candidates by hash code with few probes on average.
Why is set/dict element ordering unreliable for sets (Python)?	Hashing is salted and resizing/reinsertion can change iteration order as the table grows.
