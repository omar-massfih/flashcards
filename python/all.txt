What is the Python Data Model?	The set of protocols (special methods) that let objects support core language features and idiomatic syntax.
What are “special methods” in Python?	Methods with `__double_underscores__` that the interpreter calls to implement language features.
What does “dunder” mean?	“Double underscore” (before and after a name), e.g., `__len__`.
What does `obj[key]` use under the hood?	`obj.__getitem__(key)`
What does `len(obj)` use under the hood?	`obj.__len__()`
Should user code call special methods directly?	Usually no; prefer the related built-ins/syntax (e.g., `len(x)`, `iter(x)`, `str(x)`).
Why prefer built-ins over calling special methods directly?	Built-ins can add behavior and may be faster (especially for built-in types).
How does `for x in obj:` start iteration?	It calls `iter(obj)`, which uses `obj.__iter__()` or may fall back to `obj.__getitem__()`.
What two special methods are enough to make an object behave like a basic sequence?	`__len__` and `__getitem__`.
What features do `__len__` + `__getitem__` typically enable?	`len()`; indexing; slicing; iteration.
How can implementing standard protocols help you use the standard library?	Stdlib functions that expect those protocols can work without custom adapters (e.g., choosing an item from a sequence).
How does `x in collection` work if `__contains__` is missing?	It can do a sequential scan using iteration.
What is `__repr__` for?	Unambiguous representation for debugging/inspection; used by `repr()` and typically by the interactive console.
What is `__str__` for?	User-friendly display string; used by `str()` and `print()`.
If you implement only one, prefer `__repr__` or `__str__`?	`__repr__`.
What’s a good rule of thumb for `__repr__`?	Make it unambiguous; if possible, make it resemble code to recreate the object.
How do you force `repr` formatting in an f-string?	Use `!r`, e.g. ``f"{x!r}"``.
What does `abs(obj)` use under the hood?	`obj.__abs__()`
Which operator corresponds to `__add__`?	`+` (e.g., `a + b` triggers `a.__add__(b)`).
Which operator corresponds to `__mul__`?	`*` (e.g., `a * b` triggers `a.__mul__(b)`).
What’s the expected behavior of infix operators for user-defined types?	They usually return a new object and don’t mutate the operands.
What special method controls truthiness?	`__bool__`
If `__bool__` isn’t defined, what does Python use for truthiness?	`__len__` (zero → falsy; nonzero → truthy).
If neither `__bool__` nor `__len__` is defined, are instances truthy?	Yes; instances are truthy by default.
What must `__bool__` return?	A Boolean (`True` or `False`).
Why is `len(x)` not `x.len()` in Python (design rationale)?	`len` is a language-level operation optimized for built-ins, and user types participate via `__len__`.
Data model benefit for users of your class?	They use standard syntax for standard operations instead of memorizing custom method names.
Data model benefit for authors of classes?	Your objects “plug into” core features and the standard library by implementing the right special methods.
What warning does Python give about using `__*__` names?	Don’t invent/abuse `__*__` names outside documented uses; they may break without warning.
