Python variables: are they “boxes” or “labels”?	Labels (names bound to objects), not boxes that contain copies.
What does assignment do in Python (high level)?	Binds a name to an object; it does not copy the object.
What is aliasing (Python)?	Multiple names bound to the same object.
If b = a and a refers to a mutable object, what happens to b when you mutate through a?	b reflects the same change because both names reference the same object.
In `x = <expr>`, what is evaluated first in Python?	The right-hand side expression is evaluated first; then `x` is bound.
Why can `y = Gizmo() * 10` create an instance but still not bind `y`?	The RHS creates the object, then an error occurs before binding; `y` is never created.
What’s a clearer verb than “assign” for Python names?	“Bind”: `x = ...` binds the name `x` to an object.
Why is “the variable is bound to the object” more precise than “the object is assigned to the variable”?	The object must exist first; then a name can be bound to it.
What are the three core properties every Python object has?	Identity, type, and value.
Can an object’s identity change during its lifetime (Python)?	No; identity is stable for the life of the object.
What does `id(obj)` return (Python, high level)?	An integer representing the object’s identity (implementation-dependent).
In CPython, what is `id(obj)` typically?	The memory address of the object (implementation detail).
What does `is` compare (Python)?	Object identity.
What does `==` compare (Python)?	Object value/equality (typically via `__eq__`).
Why is `is` typically faster than `==` (Python)?	`is` can’t be overloaded; it’s essentially an identity comparison.
When is `is` the right tool in Python code?	Comparing to singletons like `None` or a sentinel object.
Idiom: how do you test for `None` in Python?	`x is None` (and `x is not None`).
How do you create a sentinel object for identity checks (Python)?	`SENTINEL = object()` and compare with `is`.
Common pitfall: when is using `is` usually wrong?	For value equality like strings/integers/collections; use `==` instead.
What does it mean that Python collections are “containers”?	They hold references to other objects.
What does tuple immutability actually guarantee (Python)?	The tuple’s stored references don’t change; referenced mutable objects can still mutate.
How can a tuple “value” appear to change even if the tuple is immutable?	If it references a mutable item that changes in place.
In a tuple containing a mutable item, what about that item is stable from the tuple’s perspective?	The identity of the referenced item (the reference stored in the tuple).
Why can a tuple be unhashable (Python)?	If it contains an unhashable/mutable item, its value may not be stable for hashing.
What is a shallow copy (Python)?	A new outer container that shares references to the same inner items.
How do you make a shallow copy of a list (common ways)?	`list(x)`, `x[:]`, or `x.copy()`.
In a shallow copy, what happens if you mutate a shared inner list?	The mutation is visible through both the original and the shallow copy.
What is a deep copy (Python)?	A copy that recursively copies nested objects so inner items are not shared.
How do you make shallow vs deep copies of arbitrary objects (Python)?	`copy.copy(x)` vs `copy.deepcopy(x)`.
Why can `deepcopy` handle cyclic references safely (Python)?	It memoizes objects already copied to avoid infinite recursion.
Why can a deep copy be undesirable (Python)?	It may be too expensive or may copy things that shouldn’t be copied (resources/singletons).
How can a class customize copying behavior (Python)?	Implement `__copy__` and `__deepcopy__`.
What is Python’s parameter passing model called?	Call by sharing.
Under call by sharing, what does a function receive for each argument?	A copy of the reference to the same object.
What can a function do to a mutable argument under call by sharing?	Mutate the object, affecting the caller’s view.
What can a function not do to the caller’s bindings under call by sharing?	It can’t rebind the caller’s name to a different object.
Mutating vs rebinding: what’s the difference inside a function (Python)?	Mutation affects the shared object; rebinding only changes the local parameter name.
Augmented assignment (`+=`): what’s the high-level rule for mutables vs immutables?	Mutables often change in place; immutables create a new object and rebind.
Why can `a += b` differ for lists vs tuples (Python)?	Lists can mutate in place; tuples are immutable so a new tuple is created.
When are default parameter values evaluated (Python)?	Once at function definition time (typically module import).
Where are positional default parameter values stored (Python)?	On the function object (e.g., `func.__defaults__`).
Why are mutable default arguments dangerous (Python)?	Mutations persist and affect future calls that use the default.
Safe pattern for optional mutable parameters (Python)?	Default to `None`, then create a new list/dict inside the function.
Why use `if x is None:` for optional parameters (Python)?	Distinguishes “argument omitted” from an empty container provided by the caller.
If a default list is mutated, who observes that mutation later?	Any future call that relies on that default object.
Defensive design: when should you copy a mutable argument received by an API?	When you don’t intend to mutate the caller’s object / to avoid surprising aliasing.
Why can aliasing an argument violate “least astonishment”?	The caller sees their own data structure mutated as a side effect.
How do you defensively create your own list from an iterable argument?	`list(iterable)`.
Why is `list(iterable)` a flexible defensive-copy pattern?	It accepts any iterable and ensures you own a mutable list.
Is `del` a function or a statement in Python?	A statement.
What does `del name` actually delete (Python)?	The reference/binding, not the underlying object.
When can an object be garbage-collected (Python, high level)?	When it becomes unreachable (no strong references).
In CPython, what primary mechanism destroys most objects promptly?	Reference counting (plus a cycle detector for cyclic garbage).
What problem does cyclic garbage collection address (CPython)?	Unreachable reference cycles that reference counting alone can’t free.
Is destruction timing guaranteed across Python implementations?	No; you should not rely on immediate finalization.
What is `__del__` for (Python)?	A finalizer hook when an object is about to be destroyed; tricky and rarely needed.
Why is relying on `__del__`/GC timing risky?	Finalization may be delayed or behave differently across implementations/cycles.
What is a weak reference (Python)?	A reference that doesn’t keep the target alive (doesn’t increase refcount).
What does `weakref.finalize(obj, callback)` do (Python)?	Calls `callback` when `obj` is garbage-collected.
Why doesn’t `weakref.finalize` keep the object alive?	It tracks the object via a weak reference.
Best practice for files vs relying on GC to close them?	Use `with open(...) as f:` to guarantee closure even on errors.
What does `tuple(t)` do if `t` is already a tuple?	Returns `t` itself (no copy).
In CPython, what can a full slice `t[:]` do for a tuple `t`?	It may return the same tuple object (optimization); don’t rely on identity.
What does `frozenset.copy()` typically return (Python)?	The same object (since it’s immutable).
What is interning (Python, high level)?	Reusing identical immutable objects for efficiency.
Why shouldn’t you rely on interning for program logic?	It’s an implementation detail; use `==` for value comparisons.
What does `a is not b` express (Python)?	That `a` and `b` are different objects (different identity).
Can two distinct objects compare equal with `==`?	Yes; they can have equal values but different identities.
If a class doesn’t override `__eq__`, what does `==` typically compare?	Identity (via `object.__eq__`).
Why can `==` be more expensive than `is` (Python)?	It can traverse/compare large or nested structures.
In a shallow copy, are nested objects duplicated by default?	No; nested objects are typically shared (same references).
Debugging tip: how to tell whether two similar-looking values are aliases?	Compare identity with `is` or compare `id(...)`.
What is rebinding (Python)?	Binding a name to a different object than it previously referenced.
In CPython, what often happens when the last reference to an object is removed?	The object is destroyed immediately (refcount reaches zero).
Why is the “variables are boxes” metaphor misleading for Python assignment?	Because assignment binds names to existing objects; multiple names can refer to one object.
