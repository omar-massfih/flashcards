What does “functions are first-class objects” mean (Python)?	Functions can be created at runtime; assigned; stored; passed as args; returned from functions.
What is a first-class object (PL definition, Python context)?	An entity you can create at runtime, bind to names, pass as arguments, and return as results.
How do you confirm a Python function is an object (one attribute example)?	It has attributes like `__doc__` (docstring).
What does `type(my_function)` typically show (Python)?	`<class 'function'>`.
What does `__doc__` store on a function object (Python)?	The function’s docstring text (or `None` if absent).
What tool commonly uses `__doc__` to display help (Python)?	`help(obj)` (and IDE/doc tools).
Give one example of binding a function to another name (Python).	`alias = func` (then call `alias(...)`).
What does `map(func, iterable)` do (Python)?	Returns an iterator yielding `func(x)` for each `x` in the iterable.
What is a higher-order function (Python)?	A function that takes a function as an argument and/or returns a function.
`sorted(..., key=...)`: what is `key` for (Python)?	A 1-arg function used to compute sort keys for each item.
Why can `key=len` be useful with `sorted` (Python)?	It sorts items by their length without modifying the items.
What does “functional style” often rely on (Python feature)?	Passing functions around (higher-order functions and callables).
What happened to `apply` in Python 3 (vs Python 2)?	Removed; use `fn(*args, **kwargs)` instead.
Modern Python: what often replaces `map` for building lists?	List comprehensions (or generator expressions for lazy pipelines).
Modern Python: what often replaces `filter` for selecting items?	A comprehension with an `if` clause (listcomp/genexp).
In Python 3, what do `map` and `filter` return?	Iterators (lazy results), not lists.
Where is `reduce` found in Python 3?	`functools.reduce` (it’s no longer a built-in).
What is the most common “reduce-like” task, and its preferred built-in (Python)?	Summation; use `sum(...)`.
What is the high-level idea of “reducing” (Python/FP)?	Combine a series of values into one accumulated result.
What do `all(iterable)` and `any(iterable)` do (Python)?	`all`: True if no falsy elements; `any`: True if any truthy element.
What does `all([])` return (Python)?	`True`.
What does `any([])` return (Python)?	`False`.
What does `lambda` create (Python)?	An anonymous function object.
What restriction applies to the body of a `lambda` (Python)?	It must be a single expression (no statements like `while`, `try`, `=` assignment).
Why is `lambda` usually best kept small in Python?	Nontrivial lambdas get hard to read; prefer a named `def`.
Refactoring tip: how to replace a hard-to-read lambda (Python)?	Describe it in a comment → name it → rewrite as `def` → delete comment.
Is `lambda` fundamentally different from `def` (Python)?	No; both create function objects (lambda is syntax sugar for an unnamed function).
What built-in checks whether an object can be called with `()` (Python)?	`callable(obj)`.
Why is `callable(obj)` safer than checking types directly (Python)?	Many non-function objects are callable (classes, instances with `__call__`, etc.).
What makes an instance callable (Python)?	Defining a `__call__(self, ...)` method on its class.
Why are callable instances useful (Python)?	They can keep internal state across calls (function-like objects with memory).
What is a common `__call__` pattern for a stateful object (Python)?	`__call__` delegates to a regular method (e.g., `return self.pick()`).
Defensive practice: why copy an iterable in `__init__` (Python)?	To avoid unexpected side effects if the caller later mutates their list.
Name the “nine flavors” of callable objects (Python data model, 3.9 list).	User-defined functions; built-in functions; built-in methods; methods; classes; instances with `__call__`; generator functions; native coroutine functions; async generator functions.
When you call a class, which methods are involved (Python, high level)?	`__new__` creates the instance; `__init__` initializes it.
What does calling a generator function return (Python)?	A generator object (an iterator), not the final application data.
What does calling an `async def` function return (Python)?	A coroutine object.
What does calling an async generator function return (Python)?	An async generator (used with `async for`).
What is “method syntax” enabled by callables (Python)?	Using dot notation to call methods on an instance, e.g. `obj.method(...)`.
What do `*args` capture in a function definition (Python)?	Extra positional arguments, collected into a tuple.
What do `**kwargs` capture in a function definition (Python)?	Extra keyword arguments, collected into a dict.
How do you unpack an iterable into positional arguments in a call (Python)?	Use `*iterable`, e.g. `fn(*args_list)`.
How do you unpack a mapping into keyword arguments in a call (Python)?	Use `**mapping`, e.g. `fn(**kwargs_dict)`.
What is a keyword-only argument (Python)?	A parameter that can only be passed by keyword, not position.
How do you declare keyword-only parameters (Python)?	Place them after `*args` or after a bare `*` in the signature.
How do you declare keyword-only params without `*args` (Python)?	Use a bare `*`, e.g. `def f(a, *, b): ...`.
Can a keyword-only parameter be required (Python)?	Yes; omit its default value.
Why do some APIs use `class_=` instead of `class=` (Python)?	`class` is a reserved keyword, so `class_` is a common workaround.
Can you pass a keyword named `"class"` via `**attrs` despite `class` being reserved (Python)?	Yes; dict keys are strings and `fn(**{'class': 'x'})` is allowed.
What are positional-only parameters (Python ≥ 3.8)?	Parameters that must be passed positionally, not by keyword.
How do you declare positional-only parameters in Python (syntax)?	Use `/` in the parameter list; parameters left of `/` are positional-only.
Why do positional-only parameters exist (common rationale)?	To match/lock an API and avoid exposing parameter names as part of the call contract.
Which built-in is a classic example of positional-only args (Python)?	`divmod(a, b)` (can’t be called as `divmod(a=..., b=...)`).
What module provides function equivalents for many operators (Python)?	`operator`.
Why use `operator.mul` with `reduce` (Python)?	Avoid trivial lambdas like `lambda a,b: a*b`; improves readability.
What does `operator.itemgetter(n)` produce (Python)?	A function that fetches item `obj[n]` from its argument.
Why can `itemgetter` work with mappings too (Python)?	It uses `__getitem__`, which dicts and many other types support.
What does `itemgetter(i, j, ...)` return (Python)?	A function returning a tuple of extracted items.
What does `operator.attrgetter('name')` produce (Python)?	A function that reads the named attribute from its argument.
What does dotted notation in `attrgetter` mean (Python)?	It traverses nested attributes, e.g. `'coord.lat'`.
What does `attrgetter(a, b, ...)` return (Python)?	A function returning a tuple of extracted attributes.
What does `operator.methodcaller('upper')` produce (Python)?	A function that calls `.upper()` on its argument.
What does `methodcaller('replace', ' ', '-')` do (Python)?	Calls `.replace(' ', '-')` on its argument (freezes extra args).
What do `operator.iadd`, `operator.imul`, etc. correspond to (Python)?	Augmented assignment operators like `+=`, `*=`.
How do “i*” operator functions behave on mutables vs immutables (Python)?	They mutate in place if possible; otherwise behave like the non-`i` version and return a new value.
What does `functools.partial(func, *args, **kwargs)` return (Python)?	A new callable with some arguments pre-bound.
Why is `partial` useful (Python)?	Adapts a callable to an API expecting fewer/different arguments (callbacks).
What attributes expose the wrapped callable and bound args on a `partial` object (Python)?	`.func`, `.args`, `.keywords`.
What is `functools.partialmethod` for (Python)?	Partial application designed for methods (descriptor-friendly).
How can `partial` help with repeated normalization patterns (Python example)?	Bind one arg of a function to create a specialized helper, e.g. `nfc = partial(unicodedata.normalize, 'NFC')`.
